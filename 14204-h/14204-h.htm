<h2><i>The Lion and the Mouse</i></h2>

<a name="chapter1" id="chapter1"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>There was unwonted bustle in the usually sleepy and dignified
New York offices of the Southern and Transcontinental Railroad
Company in lower Broadway. The supercilious, well-groomed clerks
who, on ordinary days, are far too preoccupied with their own
personal affairs to betray the slightest interest in anything not
immediately concerning them, now condescended to bestir themselves
and, gathered in little groups, conversed in subdued, eager tones.
The slim, nervous fingers of half a dozen haughty stenographers,
representing as many different types of business femininity, were
busily rattling the keys of clicking typewriters, each of their
owners intent on reducing with all possible despatch the mass of
letters which lay piled up in front of her. Through the heavy
plate-glass swinging doors, leading to the elevators and thence to
the street, came and went an army of messengers and telegraph
boys, noisy and insolent.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page10" id="page10" title="10"></a>
<p>Through the open windows the hoarse shouting of news-venders,
the rushing of elevated trains, the clanging of street cars, with
the occasional feverish dash of an ambulance&mdash;all these
familiar noises of a great city had the far-away sound peculiar to
top floors of the modern sky-scraper. The day was warm and sticky,
as is not uncommon in early May, and the overcast sky and a
distant rumbling of thunder promised rain before night.</p>

<p>The big express elevators, running smoothly and swiftly,
unloaded every few moments a number of prosperous-looking men who,
chatting volubly and affably, made their way immediately through
the outer offices towards another and larger inner office on the
glass door of which was the legend &ldquo;Directors Room.
Private.&rdquo; Each comer gave a patronizing nod in recognition
of the deferential salutation of the clerks. Earlier arrivals had
preceded them, and as they opened the door there issued from the
Directors Room a confused murmur of voices, each different in
pitch and tone, some deep and deliberate, others shrill and
nervous, but all talking earnestly and with animation as men do
when the subject under discussion is of common interest. Now and
again a voice was heard high above the others, denoting anger in
the speaker, followed by the pleading accents
<a class="pagebreak" name="page11" id="page11" title="11"></a>
of the peace-maker, who was arguing his irate colleague into
calmness. At intervals the door opened to admit other arrivals,
and through the crack was caught a glimpse of a dozen directors,
some seated, some standing near a long table covered with green
baize.</p>

<p>It was the regular quarterly meeting of the directors of the
Southern and Transcontinental Railroad Company, but it was
something more than mere routine that had called out a quorum of
such strength and which made to-day's gathering one of
extraordinary importance in the history of the road. That the
business on hand was of the greatest significance was easily to be
inferred from the concerned and anxious expression on the
directors' faces and the eagerness of the employés as they plied
each other with questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose the injunction is sustained?&rdquo; asked a
clerk in a whisper. &ldquo;Is not the road rich enough to bear the
loss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man he addressed turned impatiently to the questioner:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's all you know about railroading. Don't you
understand that this suit we have lost will be the entering wedge
for hundreds of others. The very existence of the road may be at
stake. And between
<a class="pagebreak" name="page12" id="page12" title="12"></a>
you and me,&rdquo; he added in a lower key, &ldquo;with Judge
Rossmore on the bench we never stood much show. It's Judge
Rossmore that scares 'em, not the injunction. They've found it
easy to corrupt most of the Supreme Court judges, but Judge
Rossmore is one too many for them. You could no more bribe him
than you could have bribed Abraham Lincoln.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the newspapers say that he, too, has been caught
accepting $50,000 worth of stock for that decision he rendered in
the Great Northwestern case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lies! All those stories are lies,&rdquo; replied the
other emphatically. Then looking cautiously around to make sure no
one overheard he added contemptuously, &ldquo;The big interests
fear him, and they're inventing these lies to try and injure him.
They might as well try to blow up Gibraltar. The fact is the
public is seriously aroused this time and the railroads are in a
panic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true. The railroad, which heretofore had considered
itself superior to law, had found itself checked in its career of
outlawry and oppression. The railroad, this modern octopus of
steam and steel which stretches its greedy tentacles out over the
land, had at last been brought to book.</p>

<p>At first, when the country was in the earlier stages of its
development, the railroad appeared in the guise of a public
benefactor. It brought to the markets of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page13" id="page13" title="13"></a>
the East the produce of the South and West. It opened up new and
inaccessible territory and made oases of waste places. It brought
to the city coal, lumber, food and other prime necessaries of
life, taking back to the farmer and the woodsman in exchange,
clothes and other manufactured goods. Thus, little by little, the
railroad wormed itself into the affections of the people and
gradually became an indispensable part of the life it had itself
created. Tear up the railroad and life itself is
extinguished.</p>

<p>So when the railroad found it could not be dispensed with, it
grew dissatisfied with the size of its earnings. Legitimate
profits were not enough. Its directors cried out for bigger
dividends, and from then on the railroad became a conscienceless
tyrant, fawning on those it feared and crushing without mercy
those who were defenceless. It raised its rates for hauling
freight, discriminating against certain localities without reason
or justice, and favouring other points where its own interests
lay. By corrupting government officials and other unlawful methods
it appropriated lands, and there was no escape from its exactions
and brigandage. Other roads were built, and for a brief period
there was held out the hope of relief that invariably comes from
honest competition. But the railroad either absorbed its rivals or
pooled interests with
<a class="pagebreak" name="page14" id="page14" title="14"></a>
them, and thereafter there were several masters instead of
one.</p>

<p>Soon the railroads began to war among themselves, and in a mad
scramble to secure business at any price they cut each other's
rates and unlawfully entered into secret compacts with certain big
shippers, permitting the latter to enjoy lower freight rates than
their competitors. The smaller shippers were soon crushed out of
existence in this way. Competition was throttled and prices went
up, making the railroad barons richer and the people poorer. That
was the beginning of the giant Trusts, the greatest evil American
civilization has yet produced, and one which, unless checked, will
inevitably drag this country into the throes of civil strife.</p>

<p>From out this quagmire of corruption and rascality emerged the
Colossus, a man so stupendously rich and with such unlimited
powers for evil that the world has never looked upon his like. The
famous Cr&oelig;sus, whose fortune was estimated at only eight
millions in our money, was a pauper compared with John Burkett
Ryder, whose holdings no man could count, but which were
approximately estimated at a thousand millions of dollars. The
railroads had created the Trust, the ogre of corporate greed, of
which Ryder was the incarnation, and in time the Trust became
<a class="pagebreak" name="page15" id="page15" title="15"></a>
master of the railroads, which after all seemed but retributive
justice.</p>

<p>John Burkett Ryder, the richest man in the world&mdash;the man
whose name had spread to the farthest corners of the earth because
of his wealth, and whose money, instead of being a blessing,
promised to become not only a curse to himself but a source of
dire peril to all mankind&mdash;was a genius born of the railroad
age. No other age could have brought him forth; his peculiar
talents fitted exactly the conditions of his time. Attracted early
in life to the newly discovered oil fields of Pennsylvania, he
became a dealer in the raw product and later a refiner, acquiring
with capital, laboriously saved, first one refinery, then another.
The railroads were cutting each other's throats to secure the
freight business of the oil men, and John Burkett Ryder saw his
opportunity. He made secret overtures to the road, guaranteeing a
vast amount of business if he could get exceptionally low rates,
and the illegal compact was made. His competitors, undersold in
the market, stood no chance, and one by one they were crushed out
of existence. Ryder called these man&oelig;uvres
&ldquo;business&rdquo;; the world called them brigandage. But the
Colossus prospered and slowly built up the foundations of the
extraordinary fortune which is the talk and the wonder of the
world to-day.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page16" id="page16" title="16"></a>
Master now of the oil situation, Ryder succeeded in his ambition
of organizing the Empire Trading Company, the most powerful, the
most secretive, and the most wealthy business institution the
commercial world has yet known.</p>

<p>Yet with all this success John Burkett Ryder was still not
content. He was now a rich man, richer by many millions that he
had dreamed he could ever be, but still he was unsatisfied. He
became money mad. He wanted to be richer still, to be the richest
man in the world, the richest man the world had ever known. And
the richer he got the stronger the idea grew upon him with all the
force of a morbid obsession. He thought of money by day, he
dreamt of it at night. No matter by what questionable device it
was to be procured, more gold and more must flow into his already
overflowing coffers. So each day, instead of spending the rest of
his years in peace, in the enjoyment of the wealth he had
accumulated, he went downtown like any twenty-dollar-a-week clerk
to the tall building in lower Broadway and, closeted with his
associates, toiled and plotted to make more money.</p>

<p>He acquired vast copper mines and secured control of this and
that railroad. He had invested heavily in the Southern and
Transcontinental road and was chairman of its board of directors.
Then he and his
<a class="pagebreak" name="page17" id="page17" title="17"></a>
fellow-conspirators planned a great financial coup. The millions
were not coming in fast enough. They must make a hundred millions
at one stroke. They floated a great mining company to which the
public was invited to subscribe. The scheme having the endorsement
of the Empire Trading Company no one suspected a snare, and such
was the magic of John Ryder's name that gold flowed in from every
point of the compass. The stock sold away above par the day it was
issued. Men deemed themselves fortunate if they were even granted
an allotment. What matter if, a few days later, the house of cards
came tumbling down, and a dozen suicides were strewn along Wall
Street, that sinister thoroughfare which, as a wit has said, has a
graveyard at one end and the river at the other! Had Ryder any
twinges of conscience? Hardly. Had he not made a cool twenty
millions by the deal?</p>

<p>Yet this commercial pirate, this Napoleon of finance, was not a
wholly bad man. He had his redeeming qualities, like most bad men.
His most pronounced weakness, and the one that had made him the
most conspicuous man of his time, was an entire lack of moral
principle. No honest or honourable man could have amassed such
stupendous wealth. In other words, John Ryder had not been
equipped by Nature
<a class="pagebreak" name="page18" id="page18" title="18"></a>
with a conscience. He had no sense of right, or wrong, or justice
where his own interests were concerned. He was the prince of
egoists. On the other hand, he possessed qualities which, with
some people, count as virtues. He was pious and regular in his
attendance at church and, while he had done but little for
charity, he was known to have encouraged the giving of alms by the
members of his family, which consisted of a wife, whose timid
voice was rarely heard, and a son Jefferson, who was the destined
successor to his gigantic estate.</p>

<p>Such was the man who was the real power behind the Southern and
Transcontinental Railroad. More than anyone else Ryder had been
aroused by the present legal action, not so much for the money
interest at stake as that any one should dare to thwart his will.
It had been a pet scheme of his, this purchase for a song, when
the land was cheap, of some thousand acres along the line, and it
is true that at the time of the purchase there had been some idea
of laying the land out as a park. But real estate values had
increased in astonishing fashion, the road could no longer afford
to carry out the original scheme, and had attempted to dispose of
the property for building purposes, including a right of way for a
branch road. The news, made public in the newspapers, had raised
<a class="pagebreak" name="page19" id="page19" title="19"></a>
a storm of protest. The people in the vicinity claimed that the
railroad secured the land on the express condition of a park being
laid out, and in order to make a legal test they had secured an
injunction, which had been sustained by Judge Rossmore of the
United States Circuit Court.</p>

<p>These details were hastily told and re-told by one clerk to
another as the babel of voices in the inner room grew louder, and
more directors kept arriving from the ever-busy elevators. The
meeting was called for three o'clock. Another five minutes and the
chairman would rap for order. A tall, strongly built man with
white moustache and kindly smile emerged from the directors room
and, addressing one of the clerks, asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Ryder arrived yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The alacrity with which the employé hastened forward to reply
would indicate that his interlocutor was a person of more than
ordinary importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Senator, not yet. We expect him any minute.&rdquo;
Then with a deferential smile he added: &ldquo;Mr. Ryder usually
arrives on the stroke, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senator gave a nod of acquiescence and, turning on his
heel, greeted with a grasp of the hand and affable smile his
fellow-directors as they passed in by twos and threes.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page20" id="page20" title="20"></a>
<p>Senator Roberts was in the world of politics what his friend
John Burkett Ryder was in the world of finance&mdash;a leader of
men. He started life in Wisconsin as an errand boy, was educated
in the public schools, and later became clerk in a dry-goods
store, finally going into business for his own account on a large
scale. He was elected to the Legislature, where his ability as an
organizer soon gained the friendship of the men in power, and
later was sent to Congress, where he was quickly initiated in the
game of corrupt politics. In 1885 he entered the United States
Senate. He soon became the acknowledged leader of a considerable
majority of the Republican senators, and from then on he was a
figure to be reckoned with. A very ambitious man, with a great
love of power and few scruples, it is little wonder that only the
practical or dishonest side of politics appealed to him. He was in
politics for all there was in it, and he saw in his lofty position
only a splendid opportunity for easy graft.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate to make such alliances with corporate
interests seeking influence at Washington as would enable him to
accomplish this purpose, and in this way he had met and formed a
strong friendship with John Burkett Ryder. Each being a master in
his own field was useful to the other.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page21" id="page21" title="21"></a>
Neither was troubled with qualms of conscience, so they never
quarrelled. If the Ryder interests needed anything in the Senate,
Roberts and his followers were there to attend to it. Just now the
cohort was marshalled in defence of the railroads against the
attacks of the new Rebate bill. In fact, Ryder managed to keep the
Senate busy all the time. When, on the other hand, the senators
wanted anything&mdash;and they often did&mdash;Ryder saw that they
got it, lower rates for this one, a fat job for that one, not
forgetting themselves. Senator Roberts was already a very rich
man, and although the world often wondered where he got it, no one
had the courage to ask him.</p>

<p>But the Republican leader was stirred with an ambition greater
than that of controlling a majority in the Senate. He had a
daughter, a marriageable young woman who, at least in her father's
opinion, would make a desirable wife for any man. His friend Ryder
had a son, and this son was the only heir to the greatest fortune
ever amassed by one man, a fortune which, at its present rate of
increase, by the time the father died and the young couple were
ready to inherit, would probably amount to over <i>six billions of
dollars</i>. Could the human mind grasp the possibilities of such
a colossal fortune? It staggered the imagination. Its owner, or
the man who controlled
<a class="pagebreak" name="page22" id="page22" title="22"></a>
it, would be master of the world! Was not this a prize any man
might well set himself out to win? The senator was thinking of it
now as he stood exchanging banal remarks with the men who accosted
him. If he could only bring off that marriage he would be content.
The ambition of his life would be attained. There was no
difficulty as far as John Ryder was concerned. He favoured the
match and had often spoken of it. Indeed, Ryder desired it, for
such an alliance would naturally further his business interests in
every way. Roberts knew that his daughter Kate had more than a
liking for Ryder's handsome young son. Moreover, Kate was
practical, like her father, and had sense enough to realize what
it would mean to be the mistress of the Ryder fortune. No, Kate
was all right, but there was young Ryder to reckon with. It would
take two in this case to make a bargain.</p>

<p>Jefferson Ryder was, in truth, an entirely different man from
his father. It was difficult to realize that both had sprung from
the same stock. A college-bred boy with all the advantages his
father's wealth could give him, he had inherited from the parent
only those characteristics which would have made him successful
even if born poor&mdash;activity, pluck, application, dogged
obstinacy, alert mentality. To these qualities he
<a class="pagebreak" name="page23" id="page23" title="23"></a>
added what his father sorely lacked&mdash;a high notion of honour,
a keen sense of right and wrong. He had the honest man's contempt
for meanness of any description, and he had little patience with
the lax so-called business morals of the day. For him a
dishonourable or dishonest action could have no apologist, and he
could see no difference between the crime of the hungry wretch who
stole a loaf of bread and the coal baron who systematically robbed
both his employés and the public. In fact, had he been on the
bench he would probably have acquitted the human derelict who, in
despair, had appropriated the prime necessary of life, and sent
the over-fed, conscienceless coal baron to jail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do unto others as you would have others do unto
you.&rdquo; This simple and fundamental axiom Jefferson Ryder had
adopted early in life, and it had become his religion&mdash;the
only one, in fact, that he had. He was never pious like his
father, a fact much regretted by his mother, who could see nothing
but eternal damnation in store for her son because he never went
to church and professed no orthodox creed. She knew him to be a
good lad, but to her simple mind a conduct of life based merely on
a system of moral philosophy was the worst kind of paganism. There
could, she argued, be no religion, and assuredly no salvation,
outside the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page24" id="page24" title="24"></a>
dogmatic teachings of the Church. But otherwise Jefferson was a
model son and, with the exception of this bad habit of thinking
for himself on religious matters, really gave her no anxiety. When
Jefferson left college, his father took him into the Empire
Trading Company with the idea of his eventually succeeding him as
head of the concern, but the different views held by father and
son on almost every subject soon led to stormy scenes that made
the continuation of the arrangement impossible. Senator Roberts
was well aware of these unfortunate independent tendencies in John
Ryder's son, and while he devoutly desired the consummation of
Jefferson's union with his daughter, he quite realized that the
young man was a nut which was going to be exceedingly hard to
crack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, senator, you're always on time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Disturbed in his reflections, Senator Roberts looked up and saw
the extended hand of a red-faced, corpulent man, one of the
directors. He was no favourite with the senator, but the latter
was too keen a man of the world to make enemies uselessly, so he
condescended to place two fingers in the outstretched fat
palm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, Mr. Grimsby? Well, what are we going to do
about this injunction? The case has gone against us. I knew Judge
Rossmore's decision
<a class="pagebreak" name="page25" id="page25" title="25"></a>
would be for the other side. Public opinion is aroused. The
press&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grimsby's red face grew more apoplectic as he blurted
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Public opinion and the press be d&mdash;&mdash;d. Who
cares for public opinion? What is public opinion, anyhow? This
road can manage its own affairs or it can't. If it can't I for one
quit railroading. The press! Pshaw! It's all graft, I tell you.
It's nothing but a strike! I never knew one of these virtuous
outbursts that wasn't. First the newspapers bark ferociously to
advertise themselves; then they crawl round and whine like a cur.
And it usually costs something to fix matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senator smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Grimsby&mdash;not this time. It's more serious
than that. Hitherto the road has been unusually lucky in its bench
decisions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senator gave a covert glance round to see if any long ears
were listening. Then he added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can't expect always to get a favourable decision like
that in the Cartwright case, when franchise rights valued at
nearly five millions were at stake. Judge Stollmann proved
himself a true friend in that affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grimsby made a wry grimace as he retorted:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page26" id="page26" title="26"></a>
<a name="insquote1" id="insquote1"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it was worth it to him. A Supreme Court judge
don't get a cheque for $20,000 every day. That represents two
years' pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might represent two years in jail if it were found
out,&rdquo; said the senator with a forced laugh,</p>

<p>Grimsby saw an opportunity, and he could not resist the
temptation. Bluntly he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as jail's concerned, others might be getting
their deserts there too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senator looked keenly at Grimsby from under his white
eyebrows. Then in a calm, decisive tone he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's no question of a cheque this time. The road could
not buy Judge Rossmore with $200,000. He is absolutely
unapproachable in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The apoplectic face of Mr. Grimsby looked incredulous.</p>

<p>It was hard for these men who plotted in the dark, and cheated
the widow and the orphan for love of the dollar, to understand
that there were in the world, breathing the same air as they, men
who put honour, truth and justice above mere money-getting. With a
slight tinge of sarcasm he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any man in our public life who is
unapproachable from some direction or other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Judge Rossmore is such a man. He is one
<a class="pagebreak" name="page27" id="page27" title="27"></a>
of the few men in American public life who takes his duties
seriously. In the strictest sense of the term, he serves his
country instead of serving himself. I am no friend of his, but I
must do him that justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke sharply, in an irritated tone, as if resenting the
insinuation of this vulgarian that every man in public life had
his price. Roberts knew that the charge was true as far as he and
the men he consorted with were concerned, but sometimes the truth
hurts. That was why he had for a moment seemed to champion Judge
Rossmore, which, seeing that the judge himself was at that very
moment under a cloud, was an absurd thing for him to do.</p>

<p>He had known Rossmore years before when the latter was a city
magistrate in New York. That was before he, Roberts, had become a
political grafter and when the decent things in life still
appealed to him. The two men, although having few interests in
common, had seen a good deal of one another until Roberts went to
Washington when their relations were completely severed. But he
had always watched Rossmore's career, and when he was made a judge
of the Supreme Court at a comparatively early age he was sincerely
glad. If anything could have convinced Roberts that success can
come in public life to a man who pursues it by honest methods it
was the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page28" id="page28" title="28"></a>
success of James Rossmore. He could never help feeling that
Rossmore had been endowed by Nature with certain qualities which
had been denied to him, above all that ability to walk straight
through life with skirts clean which he had found impossible
himself. To-day Judge Rossmore was one of the most celebrated
judges in the country. He was a brilliant jurist and a splendid
after-dinner speaker. He was considered the most learned and able
of all the members of the judiciary, and his decisions were noted
as much for their fearlessness as for their wisdom. But what was
far more, he enjoyed a reputation for absolute integrity. Until
now no breath of slander, no suspicion of corruption, had ever
touched him. Even his enemies acknowledged that. And that is why
there was a panic to-day among the directors of the Southern and
Transcontinental Railroad. This honest, upright man had been
called upon in the course of his duty to decide matters of vital
importance to the road, and the directors were ready to stampede
because, in their hearts, they knew the weakness of their case and
the strength of the judge.</p>

<p>Grimsby, unconvinced, returned to the charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about these newspaper charges? Did Judge Rossmore
take a bribe from the Great Northwestern or didn't he? You ought
to know.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page29" id="page29" title="29"></a>
<p>&ldquo;I do know,&rdquo; answered the senator cautiously and
somewhat curtly, &ldquo;but until Mr. Ryder arrives I can say
nothing. I believe he has been inquiring into the matter. He will
tell us when he comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hands of the large clock in the outer room pointed to
three. An active, dapper little man with glasses and with books
under his arm passed hurriedly from another office into the
directors room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There goes Mr. Lane with the minutes. The meeting is
called. Where's Mr. Ryder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a general move of the scattered groups of directors
toward the committee room. The clock overhead began to strike. The
last stroke had not quite died away when the big swinging doors
from the street were thrown open and there entered a tall, thin
man, gray-headed, and with a slight stoop, but keen eyed and
alert. He was carefully dressed in a well-fitting frock coat,
white waistcoat, black tie and silk hat.</p>

<p>It was John Burkett Ryder, the Colossus.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page30" id="page30" title="30"></a>
<a name="chapter2" id="chapter2"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>At fifty-six, John Burkett Ryder was surprisingly well
preserved. With the exception of the slight stoop, already noted,
and the rapidly thinning snow-white hair, his step was as light
and elastic, and his brain as vigorous and alert, as in a man of
forty. Of old English stock, his physical make-up presented all
those strongly marked characteristics of our race which, sprung
from Anglo-Saxon ancestry, but modified by nearly 300 years of
different climate and customs, has gradually produced the distinct
and true American type, as easily recognizable among the family of
nations as any other of the earth's children. Tall and
distinguished-looking, Ryder would have attracted attention
anywhere. Men who have accomplished much in life usually bear
plainly upon their persons the indefinable stamp of achievement,
whether of good or evil, which renders them conspicuous among
their fellows. We turn after a man in the street and ask, Who is
he? And nine times out of ten the object of our curiosity is a man
who has made his mark&mdash;a successful soldier, a famous sailor,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page31" id="page31" title="31"></a>
a celebrated author, a distinguished lawyer, or even a notorious
crook.</p>

<p>There was certainly nothing in John Ryder's outward appearance
to justify Lombroso's sensational description of him: &ldquo;A
social and physiological freak, a degenerate and a prodigy of
turpitude who, in the pursuit of money, crushes with the
insensibility of a steel machine everyone who stands in his
way.&rdquo; On the contrary, Ryder, outwardly at least, was a
prepossessing-looking man. His head was well-shaped, and he had an
intellectual brow, while power was expressed in every gesture of
his hands and body. Every inch of him suggested strength and
resourcefulness. His face, when in good humour, frequently
expanded in a pleasant smile, and he had even been known to laugh
boisterously, usually at his own stories, which he rightly
considered very droll, and of which he possessed a goodly stock.
But in repose his face grew stern and forbidding, and when his
prognathous jaw, indicative of will-power and bull-dog tenacity,
snapped to with a click-like sound, those who heard it knew that
squalls were coming.</p>

<p>But it was John Ryder's eyes that were regarded as the most
reliable barometer of his mental condition. Wonderful eyes they
were, strangely eloquent and expressive, and their most singular
feature was that they
<a class="pagebreak" name="page32" id="page32" title="32"></a>
possessed the uncanny power of changing colour like a cat's. When
their owner was at peace with the world, and had temporarily
shaken off the cares of business, his eyes were of the most
restful, beautiful blue, like the sky after sunrise on a Spring
morning, and looking into their serene depths it seemed absurd to
think that this man could ever harm a fly. His face, while under
the spell of this kindly mood, was so benevolent and gentle, so
frank and honest that you felt there was nothing in the
world&mdash;purse, honour, wife, child&mdash;that, if needs be,
you would not entrust to his keeping.</p>

<p>When this period of truce was ended, when the plutocrat was
once more absorbed in controlling the political as well as the
commercial machinery of the nation, then his eyes took on a
snakish, greenish hue, and one could plainly read in them the
cunning, the avariciousness, the meanness, the insatiable thirst
for gain that had made this man the most unscrupulous money-getter
of his time. But his eyes had still another colour, and when this
last transformation took place those dependent on him, and even
his friends, quaked with fear. For they were his eyes of anger.
On these dreaded occasions his eyes grew black as darkest night
and flashed fire as lightning rends the thundercloud. Almost
ungovernable fury was, indeed,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page33" id="page33" title="33"></a>
the weakest spot in John Ryder's armour, for in these moments of
appalling wrath he was reckless of what he said or did,
friendship, self-interest, prudence&mdash;all were sacrificed.</p>

<p>Such was the Colossus on whom all eyes were turned as he
entered. Instantly the conversations stopped as by magic. The
directors nudged each other and whispered. Instinctively, Ryder
singled out his crony, Senator Roberts, who advanced with effusive
gesture:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Senator!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're punctual as usual, Mr. Ryder. I never knew you to
be late!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great man chuckled, and the little men standing around,
listening breathlessly, chuckled in respectful sympathy, and they
elbowed and pushed one another in their efforts to attract Ryder's
notice, like so many cowardly hyenas not daring to approach the
lordly wolf. Senator Roberts made a remark in a low tone to Ryder,
whereupon the latter laughed. The bystanders congratulated each
other silently. The great man was pleased to be in a good humour.
And as Ryder turned with the senator to enter the Directors Room
the light from the big windows fell full on his face, and they
noticed that his eyes were of the softest blue.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page34" id="page34" title="34"></a>
<p>&ldquo;No squalls to-day,&rdquo; whispered one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; retorted a more experienced
colleague. &ldquo;Those eyes are more fickle than the
weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside the sky was darkening, and drops of rain were already
falling. A flash of lightning presaged the coming storm.</p>

<p>Ryder passed on and into the Directors Room followed by Senator
Roberts and the other directors, the procession being brought up
by the dapper little secretary bearing the minutes.</p>

<p>The long room with its narrow centre table covered with green
baize was filled with directors scattered in little groups and all
talking at once with excited gesture. At the sight of Ryder the
chattering stopped as if by common consent, and the only sound
audible was of the shuffling of feet and the moving of chairs as
the directors took their places around the long table.</p>

<p>With a nod here and there Ryder took his place in the
chairman's seat and rapped for order. Then at a sign from the
chair the dapper little secretary began in a monotonous voice to
read the minutes of the previous meeting. No one listened, a few
directors yawned. Others had their eyes riveted on Ryder's face,
trying to read there if he had devised some plan to offset the
crushing blow of this adverse decision,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page35" id="page35" title="35"></a>
which meant a serious loss to them all. He, the master mind, had
served them in many a like crisis in the past. Could he do so
again? But John Ryder gave no sign. His eyes, still of the same
restful blue, were fixed on the ceiling watching a spider marching
with diabolical intent on a wretched fly that had become entangled
in its web. And as the secretary ambled monotonously on, Ryder
watched and watched until he saw the spider seize its helpless
prey and devour it. Fascinated by the spectacle, which doubtless
suggested to him some analogy to his own methods, Ryder sat
motionless, his eyes fastened on the ceiling, until the sudden
stopping of the secretary's reading aroused him and told him that
the minutes were finished. Quickly they were approved, and the
chairman proceeded as rapidly as possible with the regular
business routine. That disposed of, the meeting was ready for the
chief business of the day. Ryder then calmly proceeded to present
the facts in the case.</p>

<p>Some years back the road had acquired as an investment some
thousands of acres of land located in the outskirts of Auburndale,
on the line of their road. The land was bought cheap, and there
had been some talk of laying part of it out as a public park.
This promise had been made at the time in good faith,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page36" id="page36" title="36"></a>
but it was no condition of the sale. If, afterwards, owing to the
rise in the value of real estate, the road found it impossible to
carry out the original idea, surely they were masters of their own
property! The people of Auburndale thought differently and, goaded
on by the local newspapers, had begun action in the courts to
restrain the road from diverting the land from its alleged
original purpose. They had succeeded in getting the injunction,
but the road had fought it tooth and nail, and finally carried it
to the Supreme Court, where Judge Rossmore, after reserving his
opinion, had finally sustained the injunction and decided against
the railroad. That was the situation, and he would now like to
hear from the members of the board.</p>

<p>Mr. Grimsby rose. Self-confident and noisily loquacious, as
most men of his class are in simple conversation, he was plainly
intimidated at speaking before such a crowd. He did not know where
to look nor what to do with his hands, and he shuffled uneasily on
his feet, while streams of nervous perspiration ran down his fat
face, which he mopped repeatedly with a big coloured handkerchief.
At last, taking courage, he began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, for the past ten years this road has made
bigger earnings in proportion to its carrying
<a class="pagebreak" name="page37" id="page37" title="37"></a>
capacity than any other railroad in the United States. We have
had fewer accidents, less injury to rolling stock, less litigation
and bigger dividends. The road has been well managed
and&rdquo;&mdash;here he looked significantly in Ryder's
direction&mdash;&ldquo;there has been a big brain behind the
manager. We owe you that credit, Mr. Ryder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cries of &ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; came from all round the
table.</p>

<p>Ryder bowed coldly, and Mr. Grimsby continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But during the last year or two things have gone wrong.
There has been a lot of litigation, most of which has gone against
us, and it has cost a heap of money. It reduced the last quarterly
dividend very considerably, and the new complication&mdash;this
Auburndale suit, which also has gone against us&mdash;is going to
make a still bigger hole in our exchequer. Gentlemen, I don't want
to be a prophet of misfortune, but I'll tell you this&mdash;unless
something is done to stop this hostility in the courts you and I
stand to lose every cent we have invested in the road. This suit
which we have just lost means a number of others. What I would ask
our chairman is what has become of his former good relations with
the Supreme Court, what has become of his influence, which never
failed us. What are these rumours regarding Judge Rossmore?
<a class="pagebreak" name="page38" id="page38" title="38"></a>
He is charged in the newspapers with having accepted a present
from a road in whose favour he handed down a very valuable
decision. How is it that our road cannot reach Judge Rossmore and
make him presents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker sat down, flushed and breathless. The expression on
every face showed that the anxiety was general. The directors
glanced at Ryder, but his face was expressionless as marble.
Apparently he took not the slightest interest in this matter which
so agitated his colleagues.</p>

<p>Another director rose. He was a better speaker than Mr.
Grimsby, but his voice had a hard, rasping quality that smote the
ears unpleasantly. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, none of us can deny what Mr. Grimsby has
just put before us so vividly. We are threatened not with one, but
with a hundred such suits, unless something is done either to
placate the public or to render its attacks harmless. Rightly or
wrongly, the railroad is hated by the people, yet we are only what
railroad conditions compel us to be. With the present fierce
competition, no fine question of ethics can enter into our
dealings as a business organization. With an irritated public and
press on one side, and a hostile judiciary on the other, the
outlook certainly is far from bright. But is the judiciary
hostile? Is it not true that we have been
<a class="pagebreak" name="page39" id="page39" title="39"></a>
singularly free from litigation until recently, and that most of
the decisions were favourable to the road? Judge Rossmore is the
real danger. While he is on the bench the road is not safe. Yet
all efforts to reach him have failed and will fail. I do not take
any stock in the newspaper stories regarding Judge Rossmore. They
are preposterous. Judge Rossmore is too strong a man to be got rid
of so easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker sat down and another rose, his arguments being
merely a reiteration of those already heard. Ryder did not listen
to what was being said. Why should he? Was he not familiar with
every possible phase of the game? Better than these men who merely
talked, he was planning how the railroad and all his other
interests could get rid of this troublesome judge.</p>

<p>It was true. He who controlled legislatures and dictated to
Supreme Court judges had found himself powerless when each turn of
the legal machinery had brought him face to face with Judge
Rossmore. Suit after suit had been decided against him and the
interests he represented, and each time it was Judge Rossmore who
had handed down the decision. So for years these two men had
fought a silent but bitter duel in which principle on the one side
and attempted corruption on the other were the gauge of battle.
Judge
<a class="pagebreak" name="page40" id="page40" title="40"></a>
Rossmore fought with the weapons which his oath and the law
directed him to use, Ryder with the only weapons he
understood&mdash;bribery and trickery. And each time it had been
Rossmore who had emerged triumphant. Despite every man&oelig;uvre
Ryder's experience could suggest, notwithstanding every card that
could be played to undermine his credit and reputation, Judge
Rossmore stood higher in the country's confidence than when he was
first appointed.</p>

<p>So when Ryder found he could not corrupt this honest judge with
gold, he decided to destroy him with calumny. He realized that the
sordid methods which had succeeded with other judges would never
prevail with Rossmore, so he plotted to take away from this man
the one thing he cherished most&mdash;his honour. He would ruin
him by defaming his character, and so skilfully would he
accomplish his work that the judge himself would realize the
hopelessness of resistance.
<a name="typo1" id="typo1"></a>
No scruples embarrassed Ryder in arriving at this determination.
From his point of view he was fully justified. &ldquo;Business is
business. He hurts my interests; therefore I remove him.&rdquo; So
he argued, and he considered it no more wrong to wreck the
happiness of this honourable man than he would to have shot a
burglar in self-defence. So having thus tranquillized his
conscience he had gone to work in his
<a class="pagebreak" name="page41" id="page41" title="41"></a>
usually thorough manner, and his success had surpassed the most
sanguine expectations.</p>

<p>This is what he had done.</p>

<p>Like many of our public servants whose labours are compensated
only in niggardly fashion by an inconsiderate country, Judge
Rossmore was a man of but moderate means. His income as Justice of
the Supreme Court was $12,000 a year, but for a man in his
position, having a certain appearance to keep up, it little more
than kept the wolf from the door. He lived quietly but comfortably
in New York City with his wife and his daughter Shirley, an
attractive young woman who had graduated from Vassar and had shown
a marked taste for literature. The daughter's education had cost a
good deal of money, and this, together with life insurance and
other incidentals of keeping house in New York, had about taken
all he had. Yet he had managed to save a little, and those years
when he could put by a fifth of his salary the judge considered
himself lucky. Secretly, he was proud of his comparative poverty.
At least the world could never ask him &ldquo;where he got
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder was well acquainted with Judge Rossmore's private means.
The two men had met at a dinner, and although Ryder had tried to
cultivate the acquaintance, he never received much encouragement.
Ryder's son
<a class="pagebreak" name="page42" id="page42" title="42"></a>
Jefferson, too, had met Miss Shirley Rossmore and been much
attracted to her, but the father having more ambitious plans for
his heir quickly discouraged all attentions in that direction. He
himself, however, continued to meet the judge casually, and one
evening he contrived to broach the subject of profitable
investments. The judge admitted that by careful hoarding and much
stinting he had managed to save a few thousand dollars which he
was anxious to invest in something good.</p>

<p>Quick as the keen-eyed vulture swoops down on its prey the wily
financier seized the opportunity thus presented. And he took so
much trouble in answering the judge's inexperienced questions, and
generally made himself so agreeable, that the judge found himself
regretting that he and Ryder had, by force of circumstances, been
opposed to each other in public life so long. Ryder strongly
recommended the purchase of Alaskan Mining stock, a new and
booming enterprise which had lately become very active in the
market. Ryder said he had reasons to believe that the stock would
soon advance, and now there was an opportunity to get it
cheap.</p>

<p>A few days after he had made the investment the judge was
surprised to receive certificates of stock for double the amount
he had paid for. At the same
<a class="pagebreak" name="page43" id="page43" title="43"></a>
time he received a letter from the secretary of the company
explaining that the additional stock was pool stock and not to be
marketed at the present time. It was in the nature of a bonus to
which he was entitled as one of the early shareholders. The letter
was full of verbiage and technical details of which the judge
understood nothing, but he thought it very liberal of the company,
and putting the stock away in his safe soon forgot all about it.
Had he been a business man he would have scented peril. He would
have realized that he had now in his possession $50,000 worth of
stock for which he had not paid a cent, and furthermore had
deposited it when a reorganization came.</p>

<p>But the judge was sincerely grateful for Ryder's apparently
disinterested advice and wrote two letters to him, one in which he
thanked him for the trouble he had taken, and another in which he
asked him if he was sure the company was financially sound, as the
investment he contemplated making represented all his savings. He
added in the second letter that he had received stock for double
the amount of his investment, and that being a perfect child in
business transactions he had been unable to account for the extra
$50,000 worth until the secretary of the company
<a class="pagebreak" name="page44" id="page44" title="44"></a>
had written him assuring him that everything was in order. These
letters Ryder kept.</p>

<p>From that time on the Alaskan Mining Company underwent
mysterious changes. New capitalists gained control and the name
was altered to the Great Northwestern Mining Company. Then it
became involved in litigation, and one suit, the outcome of which
meant millions to the company, was carried to the Supreme Court,
where Judge Rossmore was sitting. The judge had by this time
forgotten all about the company in which he owned stock. He did
not even recall its name. He only knew vaguely that it was a mine
and that it was situated in Alaska. Could he dream that the Great
Northwestern Mining Company and the company to which he had
entrusted his few thousands were one and the same? In deciding on
the merits of the case presented to him right seemed to him to be
plainly with the Northwestern, and he rendered a decision to that
effect. It was an important decision, involving a large sum, and
for a day or two it was talked about. But as it was the opinion of
the most learned and honest judge on the bench no one dreamed of
questioning it.</p>

<p>But very soon ugly paragraphs began to appear in the
newspapers. One paper asked if it were true that Judge Rossmore
owned stock in the Great Northwestern
<a class="pagebreak" name="page45" id="page45" title="45"></a>
Mining Company which had recently benefited so signally by his
decision. Interviewed by a reporter, Judge Rossmore indignantly
denied being interested in any way in the company. Thereupon the
same paper returned to the attack, stating that the judge must
surely be mistaken as the records showed a sale of stock to him at
the time the company was known as the Alaskan Mining Company. When
he read this the judge was overwhelmed. It was true then! They had
not slandered him. It was he who had lied, but how
innocently&mdash;how innocently!</p>

<p>His daughter Shirley, who was his greatest friend and comfort,
was then in Europe. She had gone to the Continent to rest, after
working for months on a novel which she had just published. His
wife, entirely without experience in business matters and somewhat
of an invalid, was helpless to advise him. But to his old and
tried friend, ex-Judge Stott, Judge Rossmore explained the facts
as they were. Stott shook his head. &ldquo;It's a
conspiracy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And John B. Ryder is behind
it.&rdquo; Rossmore refused to believe that any man could so
deliberately try to encompass another's destruction, but when more
newspaper stories came out he began to realize that Stott was
right and that his enemies had indeed dealt him a deadly blow. One
newspaper boldly stated that
<a class="pagebreak" name="page46" id="page46" title="46"></a>
Judge Rossmore was down on the mining company's books for $50,000
more stock than he had paid for, and it went on to ask if this
were payment for the favourable decision just rendered. Rossmore,
helpless, child-like as he was in business matters, now fully
realized the seriousness of his position. &ldquo;My God! My
God!&rdquo; he cried, as he bowed his head down on his desk. And
for a whole day he remained closeted in his library, no one
venturing near him.</p>

<p>As John Ryder sat there sphinx-like at the head of the
directors' table he reviewed all this in his mind. His own part
in the work was now done and well done, and he had come to this
meeting to-day to tell them of his triumph.</p>

<p>The speaker, to whom he had paid such scant attention, resumed
his seat, and there followed a pause and an intense silence which
was broken only by the pattering of the rain against the big
windows. The directors turned expectantly to Ryder, waiting for
him to speak. What could the Colossus do now to save the
situation? Cries of &ldquo;the Chair! the Chair!&rdquo; arose on
every side. Senator Roberts leaned over to Ryder and whispered
something in his ear.</p>

<blockquote class="central">He had come to this meeting to-day to tell them
of his triumph.&mdash;<a href="#page46"><i>Page 46.</i></a></blockquote>

<p>With an acquiescent gesture, John Ryder tapped the table with
his gavel and rose to address his fellow directors. Instantly the
room was silent again as
<a class="pagebreak" name="page47" id="page47" title="47"></a>
the tomb. One might have heard a pin drop, so intense was the
attention. All eyes were fixed on the chairman. The air itself
seemed charged with electricity, that needed but a spark to set it
ablaze.</p>

<p>Speaking deliberately and dispassionately, the Master
Dissembler began.</p>

<p>They had all listened carefully, he said, to what had been
stated by previous speakers. The situation no doubt was very
critical, but they had weathered worse storms and he had every
reason to hope they would outlive this storm. It was true that
public opinion was greatly incensed against the railroads and,
indeed, against all organized capital, and was seeking to injure
them through the courts. For a time this agitation would hurt
business and lessen the dividends, for it meant not only smaller
annual earnings but that a lot of money must be spent in
Washington.</p>

<p>The eyes of the listeners, who were hanging on every word,
involuntarily turned in the direction of Senator Roberts, but the
latter, at that moment busily engaged in rummaging among a lot of
papers, seemed to have missed this significant allusion to the
road's expenses in the District of Columbia. Ryder continued:</p>

<p>In his experience such waves of reform were periodical and soon
wear themselves out, when things go
<a class="pagebreak" name="page48" id="page48" title="48"></a>
on just as they did before. Much of the agitation, doubtless, was
a strike for graft. They would have to go down in their pockets,
he supposed, and then these yellow newspapers and these yellow
magazines that were barking at their heels would let them go. But
in regard to the particular case now at issue&mdash;this
Auburndale decision&mdash;there had been no way of preventing it.
Influence had been used, but to no effect. The thing to do now
was to prevent any such disasters in future by removing the author
of them.</p>

<p>The directors bent eagerly forward. Had Ryder really got some
plan up his sleeve after all? The faces around the table looked
brighter, and the directors cleared their throats and settled
themselves down in their chairs as audiences do in the theatre
when the drama is reaching its climax.</p>

<p>The board, continued Ryder with icy calmness, had perhaps
heard, and also seen in the newspapers, the stories regarding
Judge Rossmore and his alleged connection with the Great
Northwestern Company. Perhaps they had not believed these
stories. It was only natural. He had not believed them himself.
But he had taken the trouble to inquire into the matter very
carefully, and he regretted to say that the stories were true. In
fact, they were no longer denied by Judge Rossmore himself.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page49" id="page49" title="49"></a>
<p>The directors looked at each other in amazement. Gasps of
astonishment, incredulity, satisfaction were heard all over the
room. The rumours were true, then? Was it possible?
Incredible!</p>

<p>Investigation, Ryder went on, had shown that Judge Rossmore was
not only interested in the company in whose favour, as Judge of
the Supreme Court, he had rendered an important decision, but what
was worse, he had accepted from that company a valuable
gift&mdash;that is, $50,000 worth of stock&mdash;for which he had
given absolutely nothing in return unless, as some claimed, the
weight of his influence on the bench. These facts were very ugly
and so unanswerable that Judge Rossmore did not attempt to answer
them, and the important news which he, the chairman, had to
announce to his fellow-directors that afternoon, was that Judge
Rossmore's conduct would be made the subject of an inquiry by
Congress.</p>

<p>This was the spark that was needed to ignite the electrically
charged air. A wild cry of triumph went up from this band of
jackals only too willing to fatten their bellies at the cost of
another man's ruin, and one director, in his enthusiasm, rose
excitedly from his chair and demanded a vote of thanks for John
Ryder.</p>

<p>Ryder coldly opposed the motion. No thanks were due to him, he
said deprecatingly, nor did he
<a class="pagebreak" name="page50" id="page50" title="50"></a>
think the occasion called for congratulations of any kind. It was
surely a sad spectacle to see this honoured judge, this devoted
father, this blameless citizen threatened with ruin and disgrace
on account of one false step. Let them rather sympathize with him
and his family in their misfortune. He had little more to tell.
The Congressional inquiry would take place immediately, and in all
probability a demand would be made upon the Senate for Judge
Rossmore's impeachment. It was, he added, almost unnecessary for
him to remind the Board that, in the event of impeachment, the
adverse decision in the Auburndale case would be annulled and the
road would be entitled to a new trial.</p>

<p>Ryder sat down, and pandemonium broke loose, the delighted
directors tumbling over each other in their eagerness to shake
hands with the man who had saved them. Ryder had given no hint
that he had been a factor in the working up of this case against
their common enemy, in fact he had appeared to sympathise with
him, but the directors knew well that he and he alone had been the
master mind which had brought about the happy result.</p>

<p>On a motion to adjourn, the meeting broke up, and everyone
began to troop towards the elevators. Outside the rain was now
coming down in torrents and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page51" id="page51" title="51"></a>
the lights that everywhere dotted the great city only paled when
every few moments a vivid flash of lightning rent the enveloping
gloom.</p>

<p>Ryder and Senator Roberts went down in the elevator together.
When they reached the street the senator inquired in a low
tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they really believed Rossmore was
influenced in his decision?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder glanced from the lowering clouds overhead to his electric
brougham which awaited him at the curb and replied
indifferently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not they. They don't care. All they want to believe is
that he is to be impeached. The man was dangerous and had to be
removed&mdash;no matter by what means. He is our enemy&mdash;my
enemy&mdash;and I never give quarter to my enemies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke his prognathous jaw snapped to with a click-like
sound, and in his eyes now coal-black were glints of fire. At the
same instant there was a blinding flash, accompanied by a terrific
crash, and the splinters of the flag-pole on the building
opposite, which had been struck by a bolt, fell at their feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good or a bad omen?&rdquo; asked the senator with a
nervous laugh. He was secretly afraid of lightning; but was
ashamed to admit it.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page52" id="page52" title="52"></a>
<p>&ldquo;A bad omen for Judge Rossmore!&rdquo; rejoined Ryder
coolly, as he slammed to the door of the cab, and the two men
drove rapidly off in the direction of Fifth Avenue.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page53" id="page53" title="53"></a>
<a name="chapter3" id="chapter3"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Of all the spots on this fair, broad earth where the jaded
globe wanderer, surfeited with hackneyed sight-seeing, may sit in
perfect peace and watch the world go by, there is none more
fascinating nor one presenting a more brilliant panorama of
cosmopolitan life than that famous corner on the Paris boulevards,
formed by the angle of the Boulevard des Capucines and the Place
de l'Opéra. Here, on the &ldquo;terrace&rdquo; of the Café de la
Paix, with its white and gold façade and long French windows, and
its innumerable little marble-topped tables and rattan chairs, one
may sit for hours at the trifling expense of a few <i>sous</i>,
undisturbed even by the tip-seeking <i>garçon</i>, and, if one
happens to be a student of human nature, find keen enjoyment in
observing the world-types, representing every race and nationality
under the sun, that pass and re-pass in a steady, never ceasing,
exhaustless stream. The crowd surges to and fro, past the little
tables, occasionally toppling over a chair or two in the crush,
moving up or down the great boulevards, one procession going to
the right, in the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page54" id="page54" title="54"></a>
direction of the Church of the Madeleine, the other to the left
heading toward the historic Bastille, both really going nowhere in
particular, but ambling gently and good humouredly along enjoying
the sights&mdash;and life!</p>

<p>Paris, queen of cities! Light-hearted, joyous, radiant
Paris&mdash;the playground of the nations, the Mecca of the
pleasure-seekers, the city beautiful! Paris&mdash;the siren,
frankly immoral, always seductive, ever caressing! City of a
thousand political convulsions, city of a million crimes&mdash;her
streets have run with human blood, horrors unspeakable have
stained her history, civil strife has scarred her monuments, the
German conqueror insolently has bivouaced within her walls. Yet,
like a virgin undefiled, she shows no sign of storm and stress,
she offers her dimpled cheek to the rising sun, and when fall the
shadows of night and a billion electric bulbs flash in the siren's
crown, her resplendent, matchless beauty dazzles the world!</p>

<p>As the supreme reward of virtue, the good American is promised
a visit to Paris when he dies. Those, however, of our sagacious
fellow countrymen who can afford to make the trip, usually manage
to see Lutetia before crossing the river Styx. Most Americans like
Paris&mdash;some like it so well that they have made it their
permanent home&mdash;although it must be added that in
<a class="pagebreak" name="page55" id="page55" title="55"></a>
their admiration they rarely include the Frenchman. For that
matter, we are not as a nation particularly fond of any foreigner,
largely because we do not understand him, while the foreigner for
his part is quite willing to return the compliment. He gives the
Yankee credit for commercial smartness, which has built up
America's great material prosperity; but he has the utmost
contempt for our acquaintance with art, and no profound respect
for us as scientists.</p>

<p>Is it not indeed fortunate that every nation finds itself
superior to its neighbour? If this were not so each would be
jealous of the other, and would cry with envy like a spoiled child
who cannot have the moon to play with. Happily, therefore, for the
harmony of the world, each nation cordially detests the other and
the much exploited &ldquo;brotherhood of man&rdquo; is only a
figure of speech. The Englishman, confident that he is the last
word of creation, despises the Frenchman, who, in turn, laughs at
the German, who shows open contempt for the Italian, while the
American, conscious of his superiority to the whole family of
nations, secretly pities them all.</p>

<p>The most serious fault which the American&mdash;whose one god
is Mammon and chief characteristic hustle&mdash;has to find with
his French brother is that he enjoys life too much, is never in a
hurry and, what to the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page56" id="page56" title="56"></a>
Yankee mind is hardly respectable, has a habit of playing dominoes
during business hours. The Frenchman retorts that his American
brother, clever person though he be, has one or two things still
to learn. He has, he declares, no philosophy of life. It is true
that he has learned the trick of making money, but in the things
which go to satisfy the soul he is still strangely lacking. He
thinks he is enjoying life, when really he is ignorant of what
life is. He admits it is not the American's fault, for he has
never been taught how to enjoy life. One must be educated to that
as everything else. All the American is taught is to be in a
perpetual hurry and to make money no matter how. In this mad daily
race for wealth, he bolts his food, not stopping to masticate it
properly, and consequently suffers all his life from dyspepsia. So
he rushes from the cradle to the grave, and what's the good, since
he must one day die like all the rest?</p>

<p>And what, asks the foreigner, has the American hustler
accomplished that his slower-going Continental brother has not
done as well? Are finer cities to be found in America than in
Europe, do Americans paint more beautiful pictures, or write more
learned or more entertaining books, has America made greater
progress in science? Is it not a fact that the greatest inventors
and scientists of our time&mdash;Marconi, who gave to the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page57" id="page57" title="57"></a>
world wireless telegraphy, Professor Curie, who discovered radium,
Pasteur, who found a cure for rabies, Santos-Dumont, who has
almost succeeded in navigating the air, Professor Röntgen who
discovered the X-ray&mdash;are not all these immortals Europeans?
And those two greatest mechanical inventions of our day, the
automobile and the submarine boat, were they not first introduced
and perfected in France before we in America woke up to appreciate
their use? Is it, therefore, not possible to take life easily and
still achieve?</p>

<p>The logic of these arguments, set forth in <i>Le Soir</i> in an
article on the New World, appealed strongly to Jefferson Ryder as
he sat in front of the Café de la Paix, sipping a sugared
Vermouth. It was five o'clock, the magic hour of the
<i>apéritif</i>, when the glutton taxes his wits to deceive his
stomach and work up an appetite for renewed gorging. The little
tables were all occupied with the usual before-dinner crowd. There
were a good many foreigners, mostly English and Americans and a
few Frenchmen, obviously from the provinces, with only a
sprinkling of real Parisians.</p>

<p>Jefferson's acquaintance with the French language was none too
profound, and he had to guess at half the words in the article,
but he understood enough to follow the writer's arguments. Yes, it
was quite true, he thought, the American idea of life was all
wrong.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page58" id="page58" title="58"></a>
What was the sense of slaving all one's life, piling up a mass of
money one cannot possibly spend, when there is only one life to
live? How much saner the man who is content with enough and enjoys
life while he is able to. These Frenchmen, and indeed all the
Continental nations, had solved the problem. The gaiety of their
cities, and this exuberant joy of life they communicated to all
about them, were sufficient proofs of it.</p>

<p>Fascinated by the gay scene around him Jefferson laid the
newspaper aside. To the young American, fresh from prosaic
money-mad New York, the City of Pleasure presented indeed a novel
and beautiful spectacle. How different, he mused, from his own
city with its one fashionable thoroughfare&mdash;Fifth
Avenue&mdash;monotonously lined for miles with hideous brownstone
residences, and showing little real animation except during the
Saturday afternoon parade when the activities of the smart set,
male and female, centred chiefly in such exciting diversions as
going to Huyler's for soda, taking tea at the Waldorf, and trying
to outdo each other in dress and show. New York certainly was a
dull place with all its boasted cosmopolitanism. There was no
denying that. Destitute of any natural beauty, handicapped by its
cramped geographical position between two rivers, made unsightly
by gigantic
<a class="pagebreak" name="page59" id="page59" title="59"></a>
sky-scrapers and that noisy monstrosity the Elevated Railroad,
having no intellectual interests, no art interests, no interest in
anything not immediately connected with dollars, it was a city to
dwell in and make money in, but hardly a city to <i>live</i> in.
The millionaires were building white-marble palaces, taxing the
ingenuity and the originality of the native architects, and thus
to some extent relieving the general ugliness and drab
commonplaceness, while the merchant princes had begun to invade
the lower end of the avenue with handsome shops. But in spite of
all this, in spite of its pretty girls&mdash;and Jefferson
insisted that in this one important particular New York had no
peer&mdash;in spite of its comfortable theatres and its wicked
Tenderloin, and its Rialto made so brilliant at night by thousands
of elaborate electric signs, New York still had the subdued air of
a provincial town, compared with the exuberant gaiety, the
multiple attractions, the beauties, natural and artificial, of
cosmopolitan Paris.</p>

<p>The boulevards were crowded, as usual at that hour, and the
crush of both vehicles and pedestrians was so great as to permit
of only a snail-like progress. The clumsy three-horse
omnibuses&mdash;Madeleine-Bastille&mdash;crowded inside and out
with passengers and with their neatly uniformed drivers and
conductors, so different
<a class="pagebreak" name="page60" id="page60" title="60"></a>
in appearance and manner from our own slovenly street-car rowdies,
were endeavouring to breast a perfect sea of <i>fiacres</i> which,
like a swarm of mosquitoes, appeared to be trying to go in every
direction at once, their drivers vociferating torrents of
vituperous abuse on every man, woman or beast unfortunate enough
to get in their way. As a dispenser of unspeakable profanity, the
Paris <i>cocher</i> has no equal. He is unique, no one can
approach him. He also enjoys the reputation of being the worst
driver in the world. If there is any possible way in which he can
run down a pedestrian or crash into another vehicle he will do it,
probably for the only reason that it gives him another opportunity
to display his choice stock of picturesque expletives.</p>

<p>But it was a lively, good-natured crowd and the fashionably
gowned women and the well-dressed men, the fakirs hoarsely crying
their catch-penny devices, the noble boulevards lined as far as
the eye could reach with trees in full foliage, the magnificent
Opera House with its gilded dome glistening in the warm sunshine
of a June afternoon, the broad avenue directly opposite, leading
in a splendid straight line to the famous Palais Royal, the almost
dazzling whiteness of the houses and monuments, the remarkable
cleanliness and excellent condition of the sidewalks and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page61" id="page61" title="61"></a>
streets, the gaiety and richness of the shops and restaurants, the
picturesque kiosks where they sold newspapers and
flowers&mdash;all this made up a picture so utterly unlike
anything he was familiar with at home that Jefferson sat
spellbound, delighted.</p>

<p>Yes, it was true, he thought, the foreigner had indeed learned
the secret of enjoying life. There was assuredly something else in
the world beyond mere money-getting. His father was a slave to it,
but he would never be. He was resolved on that. Yet, with all his
ideas of emancipation and progress, Jefferson was a thoroughly
practical young man. He fully understood the value of money, and
the possession of it was as sweet to him as to other men. Only he
would never soil his soul in acquiring it dishonourably. He was
convinced that society as at present organized was all wrong and
that the feudalism of the middle ages had simply given place to a
worse form of slavery&mdash;capitalistic driven labour&mdash;which
had resulted in the actual iniquitous conditions, the enriching of
the rich and the impoverishment of the poor. He was familiar with
the socialistic doctrines of the day and had taken a keen interest
in this momentous question, this dream of a regenerated mankind.
He had read Karl Marx and other socialistic writers, and while his
essentially practical mind could hardly approve all their
programme
<a class="pagebreak" name="page62" id="page62" title="62"></a>
for reorganizing the State, some of which seemed to him utopian,
extravagant and even undesirable, he realised that the socialistic
movement was growing rapidly all over the world and the day was
not far distant when in America, as to-day in Germany and France,
it would be a formidable factor to reckon with.</p>

<p>But until the socialistic millennium arrived and society was
reorganized, money, he admitted, would remain the lever of the
world, the great stimulus to effort. Money supplied not only the
necessities of life but also its luxuries, everything the material
desire craved for, and so long as money had this magic purchasing
power, so long would men lie and cheat and rob and kill for its
possession. Was life worth living without money? Could one travel
and enjoy the glorious spectacles Nature affords&mdash;the rolling
ocean, the majestic mountains, the beautiful lakes, the noble
rivers&mdash;without money? Could the book-lover buy books, the
art-lover purchase pictures? Could one have fine houses to live
in, or all sorts of modern conveniences to add to one's comfort,
without money? The philosophers declared contentment to be
happiness, arguing that the hod-carrier was likely to be happier
in his hut than the millionaire in his palace; but was not that
mere animal contentment, the happiness
<a class="pagebreak" name="page63" id="page63" title="63"></a>
which knows no higher state, the ignorance of one whose eyes have
never been raised to the heights?</p>

<p>No, Jefferson was no fool. He loved money for what pleasure,
intellectual or physical, it could give him, but he would never
allow money to dominate his life as his father had done. His
father, he knew well, was not a happy man, neither happy himself
nor respected by the world. He had toiled all his life to make his
vast fortune and now he toiled to take care of it. The galley
slave led a life of luxurious ease compared with John Burkett
Ryder. Baited by the yellow newspapers and magazines, investigated
by State committees, dogged by process-servers, haunted by
beggars, harassed by blackmailers, threatened by kidnappers,
frustrated in his attempts to bestow charity by the cry
&ldquo;tainted money&rdquo;&mdash;certainly the lot of the world's
richest man was far from being an enviable one.</p>

<p>That is why Jefferson had resolved to strike out for himself.
He had warded off the golden yoke which his father proposed to put
on his shoulders, declining the lucrative position made for him in
the Empire Trading Company, and he had gone so far as to refuse
also the private income his father offered to settle on him. He
would earn his own living. A man who has his bread buttered for
him seldom accomplishes anything
<a class="pagebreak" name="page64" id="page64" title="64"></a>
he had said, and while his father had appeared to be angry at this
open opposition to his will, he was secretly pleased at his son's
grit. Jefferson was thoroughly in earnest. If needs be, he would
forego the great fortune that awaited him rather than be forced
into questionable business methods against which his whole manhood
revolted.</p>

<p>Jefferson Ryder felt strongly about these matters, and gave
them more thought than would be expected of most young men with
his opportunities. In fact, he was unusually serious for his age.
He was not yet thirty, but he had done a great deal of reading,
and he took a keen interest in all the political and sociological
questions of the hour. In personal appearance, he was the type of
man that both men and women like&mdash;tall and athletic looking,
with smooth face and clean-cut features. He had the steel-blue
eyes and the fighting jaw of his father, and when he smiled he
displayed two even rows of very white teeth. He was popular with
men, being manly, frank and cordial in his relations with them,
and women admired him greatly, although they were somewhat
intimidated by his grave and serious manner. The truth was that he
was rather diffident with women, largely owing to lack of
experience with them.</p>

<p>He had never felt the slightest inclination for business.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page65" id="page65" title="65"></a>
He had the artistic temperament strongly developed, and his
personal tastes had little in common with Wall Street and its
feverish stock manipulating. When he was younger, he had dreamed
of a literary or art career. At one time he had even thought of
going on the stage. But it was to art that he turned finally. From
an early age he had shown considerable skill as a draughtsman, and
later a two years' course at the Academy of Design convinced him
that this was his true vocation. He had begun by illustrating for
the book publishers and for the magazines, meeting at first with
the usual rebuffs and disappointments, but, refusing to be
discouraged, he had kept on and soon the tide turned. His drawings
began to be accepted. They appeared first in one magazine, then
in another, until one day, to his great joy, he received an order
from an important firm of publishers for six wash-drawings to be
used in illustrating a famous novel. This was the beginning of
his real success. His illustrations were talked about almost as
much as the book, and from that time on everything was easy. He
was in great demand by the publishers, and very soon the young
artist, who had begun his career of independence on nothing a year
so to speak, found himself in a handsomely appointed studio in
Bryant Park, with more orders coming in than he could possibly
fill, and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page66" id="page66" title="66"></a>
enjoying an income of little less than $5,000 a year. The money
was all the sweeter to Jefferson in that he felt he had himself
earned every cent of it. This summer he was giving himself a
well-deserved vacation, and he had come to Europe partly to see
Paris and the other art centres about which his fellow students at
the Academy raved, but principally&mdash;although this he did not
acknowledge even to himself&mdash;to meet in Paris a young woman
in whom he was more than ordinarily interested&mdash;Shirley
Rossmore, daughter of Judge Rossmore, of the United States Supreme
Court, who had come abroad to recuperate after the labours on her
new novel, &ldquo;The American Octopus,&rdquo; a book which was
then the talk of two hemispheres.</p>

<p>Jefferson had read half a dozen reviews of it in as many
American papers that afternoon at the <i>New York Herald's</i>
reading room in the Avenue de l'Opéra, and he chuckled with glee
as he thought how accurately this young woman had described his
father. The book had been published under the pseudonym
&ldquo;Shirley Green,&rdquo; and he alone had been admitted into
the secret of authorship. The critics all conceded that it was the
book of the year, and that it portrayed with a pitiless pen the
personality of the biggest figure in the commercial life of
America. &ldquo;Although,&rdquo; wrote one reviewer, &ldquo;the
leading character in the book is given another
<a class="pagebreak" name="page67" id="page67" title="67"></a>
name, there can be no doubt that the author intended to give to
the world a vivid pen portrait of John Burkett Ryder. She has
succeeded in presenting a remarkable character-study of the most
remarkable man of his time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was particularly pleased with the reviews, not only for Miss
Rossmore's sake, but also because his own vanity was gratified.
Had he not collaborated on the book to the extent of acquainting
the author with details of his father's life, and his
characteristics, which no outsider could possibly have learned?
There had been no disloyalty to his father in doing this.
Jefferson admired his father's smartness, if he could not approve
his methods. He did not consider the book an attack on his father,
but rather a powerfully written pen picture of an extraordinary
man.</p>

<p>Jefferson had met Shirley Rossmore two years before at a
meeting of the Schiller Society, a pseudo-literary organization
gotten up by a lot of old fogies for no useful purpose, and at
whose monthly meetings the poet who gave the society its name was
probably the last person to be discussed. He had gone out of
curiosity, anxious to take in all the freak shows New York had to
offer, and he had been introduced to a tall girl with a pale,
thoughtful face and firm mouth. She was a writer, Miss Rossmore
told him, and this was
<a class="pagebreak" name="page68" id="page68" title="68"></a>
her first visit also to the evening receptions of the Schiller
Society. Half apologetically she added that it was likely to be
her last, for, frankly, she was bored to death. But she explained
that she had to go to these affairs, as she found them useful in
gathering material for literary use. She studied types and
eccentric characters, and this seemed to her a capital hunting
ground. Jefferson, who, as a rule, was timid with girls and
avoided them, found this girl quite unlike the others he had
known. Her quiet, forceful demeanour appealed to him strongly, and
he lingered with her, chatting about his work, which had so many
interests in common with her own, until refreshments were served,
when the affair broke up. This first meeting had been followed by
a call at the Rossmore residence, and the acquaintance had kept up
until Jefferson, for the first time since he came to manhood, was
surprised and somewhat alarmed at finding himself strangely and
unduly interested in a person of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>The young artist's courteous manner, his serious outlook on
life, his high moral principles, so rarely met with nowadays in
young men of his age and class, could hardly fail to appeal to
Shirley, whose ideals of men had been somewhat rudely shattered by
those she had hitherto met. Above all, she demanded in a man the
refinement of the true gentleman, together with
<a class="pagebreak" name="page69" id="page69" title="69"></a>
strength of character and personal courage. That Jefferson Ryder
came up to this standard she was soon convinced. He was certainly
a gentleman: his views on a hundred topics of the hour expressed
in numerous conversations assured her as to his principles, while
a glance at his powerful physique left no doubt possible as to his
courage. She rightly guessed that this was no <i>poseur</i> trying
to make an impression and gain her confidence. There was an
unmistakable ring of sincerity in all his words, and his struggle
at home with his father, and his subsequent brave and successful
fight for his own independence and self-respect, more than
substantiated all her theories. And the more Shirley let her mind
dwell on Jefferson Ryder and his blue eyes and serious manner, the
more conscious she became that the artist was encroaching more
upon her thoughts and time than was good either for her work or
for herself.</p>

<p>So their casual acquaintance grew into a real friendship and
comradeship. Further than that Shirley promised herself it should
never go. Not that Jefferson had given her the slightest hint that
he entertained the idea of making her his wife one day, only she
was sophisticated enough to know the direction in which run the
minds of men who are abnormally interested in one girl, and long
before this Shirley had made up
<a class="pagebreak" name="page70" id="page70" title="70"></a>
her mind that she would never marry. Firstly, she was devoted to
her father and could not bear the thought of ever leaving him;
secondly, she was fascinated by her literary work and she was
practical enough to know that matrimony, with its visions of
slippers and cradles, would be fatal to any ambition of that kind.
She liked Jefferson immensely&mdash;more, perhaps, than any man
she had yet met&mdash;and she did not think any the less of him
because of her resolve not to get entangled in the meshes of
Cupid. In any case he had not asked her to marry him&mdash;perhaps
the idea was far from his thoughts. Meantime, she could enjoy his
friendship freely without fear of embarrassing entanglements.</p>

<p>When, therefore, she first conceived the idea of portraying in
the guise of fiction the personality of John Burkett Ryder, the
Colossus of finance whose vast and ever-increasing fortune was
fast becoming a public nuisance, she naturally turned to Jefferson
for assistance. She wanted to write a book that would be talked
about, and which at the same time would open the eyes of the
public to this growing peril in their midst&mdash;this monster of
insensate and unscrupulous greed who, by sheer weight of his
ill-gotten gold, was corrupting legislators and judges and trying
to enslave the nation. The book, she argued, would perform a
<a class="pagebreak" name="page71" id="page71" title="71"></a>
public service in awakening all to the common danger. Jefferson
fully entered into her views and had furnished her with the
information regarding his father that she deemed of value. The
book had proven a success beyond their most sanguine expectations,
and Shirley had come to Europe for a rest after the many weary
months of work that it took to write it.</p>

<p>The acquaintance of his son with the daughter of Judge Rossmore
had not escaped the eagle eye of Ryder, Sr., and much to the
financier's annoyance, and even consternation, he had ascertained
that Jefferson was a frequent caller at the Rossmore home. He
immediately jumped to the conclusion that this could mean only one
thing, and fearing what he termed &ldquo;the consequences of the
insanity of immature minds,&rdquo; he had summoned Jefferson
peremptorily to his presence. He told his son that all idea of
marriage in that quarter was out of the question for two reasons:
One was that Judge Rossmore was his most bitter enemy, the other
was that he had hoped to see his son, his destined successor,
marry a woman of whom he, Ryder, Sr., could approve. He knew of
such a woman, one who would make a far more desirable mate than
Miss Rossmore. He alluded, of course, to Kate Roberts, the pretty
daughter of his old friend, the Senator. The family interests
would benefit by this alliance,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page72" id="page72" title="72"></a>
which was desirable from every point of view. Jefferson had
listened respectfully until his father had finished and then
grimly remarked that only one point of view had been
overlooked&mdash;his own. He did not care for Miss Roberts; he did
not think she really cared for him. The marriage was out of the
question. Whereupon Ryder, Sr., had fumed and raged, declaring
that Jefferson was opposing his will as he always did, and ending
with the threat that if his son married Shirley Rossmore without
his consent he would disinherit him.</p>

<p>Jefferson was cogitating on these incidents of the last few
months when suddenly a feminine voice which he quickly recognised
called out in English:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! Mr. Ryder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked up and saw two ladies, one young, the other middle
aged, smiling at him from an open <i>fiacre</i> which had drawn up
to the curb. Jefferson jumped from his seat, upsetting his chair
and startling two nervous Frenchmen in his hurry, and hastened
out, hat in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Rossmore, what are you doing out
driving?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You know you and Mrs. Blake
promised to dine with me to-night. I was coming round to the hotel
in a few moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Blake was a younger sister of Shirley's mother.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page73" id="page73" title="73"></a>
Her husband had died a few years previously, leaving her a small
income, and when she had heard of her niece's contemplated trip to
Europe she had decided to come to Paris to meet her and
incidentally to chaperone her. The two women were stopping at the
Grand Hotel close by, while Jefferson had found accommodations at
the Athénée.</p>

<p>Shirley explained. Her aunt wanted to go to the dressmaker's,
and she herself was most anxious to go to the Luxembourg Gardens
to hear the music. Would he take her? Then they could meet Mrs.
Blake at the hotel at seven o'clock and all go to dinner. Was he
willing?</p>

<p>Was he? Jefferson's face fairly glowed. He ran back to his
table on the <i>terrasse</i> to settle for his Vermouth,
astonished the waiter by not stopping to notice the short change
he gave him, and rushed back to the carriage.</p>

<p>A dirty little Italian girl, shrewd enough to note the young
man's attention to the younger of the American women, wheedled up
to the carriage and thrust a bunch of flowers in Jefferson's
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Achetez des fleurs, monsieur, pour la jolie
dame?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down went Jefferson's hand in his pocket and, filling the
child's hand with small silver, he flung the flowers in the
carriage. Then he turned inquiringly
<a class="pagebreak" name="page74" id="page74" title="74"></a>
to Shirley for instructions so he could direct the <i>cocher</i>.
Mrs. Blake said she would get out here. Her dressmaker was close
by, in the Rue Auber, and she would walk back to the hotel to meet
them at seven o'clock. Jefferson assisted her to alight and
escorted her as far as the <i>porte-cochère</i> of the modiste's,
a couple of doors away. When he returned to the carriage, Shirley
had already told the coachman where to go. He got in and the
<i>fiacre</i> started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Shirley, &ldquo;tell me what you have
been doing with yourself all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson was busily arranging the faded carriage rug about
Shirley, spending more time in the task perhaps than was
absolutely necessary, and she had to repeat the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing?&rdquo; he echoed with a smile, &ldquo;I've been
doing two things&mdash;waiting impatiently for seven o'clock and
incidentally reading the notices of your book.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page75" id="page75" title="75"></a>
<a name="chapter4" id="chapter4"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<a name="insquote2" id="insquote2"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, what do the papers say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Settling herself comfortably back in the carriage, Shirley
questioned Jefferson with eagerness, even anxiety. She had been
impatiently awaiting the arrival of the newspapers from
&ldquo;home,&rdquo; for so much depended on this first effort. She
knew her book had been praised in some quarters, and her
publishers had written her that the sales were bigger every day,
but she was curious to learn how it had been received by the
reviewers.</p>

<p>In truth, it had been no slight achievement for a young writer
of her inexperience, a mere tyro in literature, to attract so much
attention with her first book. The success almost threatened to
turn her head, she had told her aunt laughingly, although she was
sure it could never do that. She fully realized that it was the
subject rather than the skill of the narrator that counted in the
book's success, also the fact that it had come out at a timely
moment, when the whole world was talking of the Money Peril. Had
not President Roosevelt, in a recent sensational speech, declared
that
<a class="pagebreak" name="page76" id="page76" title="76"></a>
it might be necessary for the State to curb the colossal fortunes
of America, and was not her hero, John Burkett Ryder, the richest
of them all? Any way they looked at it, the success of the book
was most gratifying.</p>

<p>While she was an attractive, aristocratic-looking girl, Shirley
Rossmore had no serious claims to academic beauty. Her features
were irregular, and the firm and rather thin mouth lines disturbed
the harmony indispensable to plastic beauty. Yet there was in her
face something far more appealing&mdash;soul and character. The
face of the merely beautiful woman expresses nothing, promises
nothing. It presents absolutely no key to the soul within, and
often there is no soul within to have a key to. Perfect in its
outlines and coloring, it is a delight to gaze upon, just as is a
flawless piece of sculpture, yet the delight is only fleeting. One
soon grows satiated, no matter how beautiful the face may be,
because it is always the same, expressionless and soulless.
&ldquo;Beauty is only skin deep,&rdquo; said the philosopher, and
no truer dictum was ever uttered. The merely beautiful woman, who
possesses only beauty and nothing else, is kept so busy thinking
of her looks, and is so anxious to observe the impression her
beauty makes on others, that she has neither the time nor the
inclination for matters
<a class="pagebreak" name="page77" id="page77" title="77"></a>
of greater importance. Sensible men, as a rule, do not lose their
hearts to women whose only assets are their good looks. They enjoy
a flirtation with them, but seldom care to make them their wives.
The marrying man is shrewd enough to realize that domestic virtues
will be more useful in his household economy than all the academic
beauty ever chiselled out of block marble.</p>

<p>Shirley was not beautiful, but hers was a face that never
failed to attract attention. It was a thoughtful and interesting
face, with an intellectual brow and large, expressive eyes, the
face of a woman who had both brain power and ideals, and yet who,
at the same time, was in perfect sympathy with the world. She was
fair in complexion, and her fine brown eyes, alternately
reflective and alert, were shaded by long dark lashes. Her
eyebrows were delicately arched, and she had a good nose. She wore
her hair well off the forehead, which was broader than in the
average woman, suggesting good mentality. Her mouth, however, was
her strongest feature. It was well shaped, but there were firm
lines about it that suggested unusual will power. Yet it smiled
readily, and when it did there was an agreeable vision of strong,
healthy-looking teeth of dazzling whiteness. She was a little over
medium height and slender in figure, and carried
<a class="pagebreak" name="page78" id="page78" title="78"></a>
herself with that unmistakable air of well-bred independence that
bespeaks birth and culture. She dressed stylishly, and while her
gowns were of rich material, and of a cut suggesting expensive
modistes, she was always so quietly attired and in such perfect
taste, that after leaving her one could never recall what she had
on.</p>

<p>At the special request of Shirley, who wanted to get a glimpse
of the Latin Quarter, the driver took a course down the Avenue de
l'Opéra, that magnificent thoroughfare which starts at the Opéra
and ends at the Théâtre Français, and which, like many others that
go to the beautifying of the capital, the Parisians owe to the
much-despised Napoleon III. The cab, Jefferson told her, would
skirt the Palais Royal and follow the Rue de Rivoli until it came
to the Châtelet, when it would cross the Seine and drive up the
Boulevard St. Michel&mdash;the students' boulevard&mdash;until it
reached the Luxembourg Gardens. Like most of his kind, the
<i>cocher</i> knew less than nothing of the art of driving, and he
ran a reckless, zig-zag flight, in and out, forcing his way
through a confusing maze of vehicles of every description, pulling
first to the right, then to the left, for no good purpose that was
apparent, and averting only by the narrowest of margins half a
dozen bad collisions. At times the <i>fiacre</i>
<a class="pagebreak" name="page79" id="page79" title="79"></a>
lurched in such alarming fashion that Shirley was visibly
perturbed, but when Jefferson assured her that all Paris cabs
travelled in this crazy fashion and nothing ever happened, she was
comforted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;what do the papers
say about the book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Why, simply that you've
written the biggest book of the year, that's all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really! Oh, do tell me all they said!&rdquo; She was
fairly excited now, and in her enthusiasm she grasped Jefferson's
broad, sunburnt hand which was lying outside the carriage rug. He
tried to appear unconscious of the contact, which made his every
nerve tingle, as he proceeded to tell her the gist of the reviews
he had read that afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't that splendid!&rdquo; she exclaimed, when he had
finished. Then she added quickly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if your father has seen it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson grinned. He had something on his conscience, and this
was a good opportunity to get rid of it. He replied
laconically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He probably has read it by this time. I sent him a copy
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The instant the words were out of his mouth he was sorry, for
Shirley's face had changed colour.</p>

<a name="movquote1" id="movquote1"></a>
<p>&ldquo;You sent him a copy of &lsquo;The American Octopus&rsquo;?&rdquo;
<a class="pagebreak" name="page80" id="page80" title="80"></a>
she cried. &ldquo;Then he'll guess who wrote the book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, he won't,&rdquo; rejoined Jefferson calmly.
&ldquo;He has no idea who sent it to him. I mailed it
anonymously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley breathed a sigh of relief. It was so important that her
identity should remain a secret. As daughter of a Supreme Court
judge she had to be most careful. She would not embarrass her
father for anything in the world. But it was smart of Jefferson to
have sent Ryder, Sr., the book, so she smiled graciously on his
son as she asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know he got it? So many letters and packages
are sent to him that he never sees himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he saw your book all right,&rdquo; laughed
Jefferson. &ldquo;I was around the house a good deal before
sailing, and one day I caught him in the library reading
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They both laughed, feeling like mischievous children who had
played a successful trick on the hokey-pokey man. Jefferson noted
his companion's pretty dimples and fine teeth, and he thought how
attractive she was, and stronger and stronger grew the idea within
him that this was the woman who was intended by Nature to share
his life. Her slender hand
<a class="pagebreak" name="page81" id="page81" title="81"></a>
still covered his broad, sunburnt one, and he fancied he felt a
slight pressure. But he was mistaken. Not the slightest sentiment
entered into Shirley's thoughts of Jefferson. She regarded him
only as a good comrade with whom she had secrets she confided in
no one else. To that extent and to that extent alone he was
privileged above other men. Suddenly he asked her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard from home recently?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A soft light stole into the girl's face. Home! Ah, that was all
she needed to make her cup of happiness full. Intoxicated with
this new sensation of a first literary success, full of the keen
pleasure this visit to the beautiful city was giving her, bubbling
over with the joy of life, happy in the almost daily companionship
of the man she liked most in the world after her father, there was
only one thing lacking&mdash;home! She had left New York only a
month before, and she was homesick already. Her father she missed
most. She was fond of her mother, too, but the latter, being
somewhat of a nervous invalid, had never been to her quite what
her father had been. The playmate of her childhood, companion of
her girlhood, her friend and adviser in womanhood, Judge Rossmore
was to his daughter the ideal man and father. Answering
Jefferson's question she said:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page82" id="page82" title="82"></a>
<p>&ldquo;I had a letter from father last week. Everything was
going on at home as when I left. Father says he misses me sadly,
and that mother is ailing as usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled, and Jefferson smiled too. They both knew by
experience that nothing really serious ailed Mrs. Rossmore, who
was a good deal of a hypochondriac, and always so filled with
aches and pains that, on the few occasions when she really felt
well, she was genuinely alarmed.</p>

<p>The <i>fiacre</i> by this time had emerged from the Rue de
Rivoli and was rolling smoothly along the fine wooden pavement in
front of the historic Conciergerie prison where Marie Antoinette
was confined before her execution. Presently they recrossed the
Seine, and the cab, dodging the tram car rails, proceeded at a
smart pace up the &ldquo;Boul' Mich',&rdquo; which is the familiar
diminutive bestowed by the students upon that broad avenue which
traverses the very heart of their beloved <i>Quartier Latin</i>.
On the left frowned the scholastic walls of the learned Sorbonne,
in the distance towered the majestic dome of the Panthéon where
Rousseau, Voltaire and Hugo lay buried.</p>

<p>Like most of the principal arteries of the French capital, the
boulevard was generously lined with trees, now in full bloom, and
the sidewalks fairly seethed with a picturesque throng in which
mingled promiscuously
<a class="pagebreak" name="page83" id="page83" title="83"></a>
frivolous students, dapper shop clerks, sober citizens, and
frisky, flirtatious little <i>ouvrières</i>, these last being all
hatless, as is characteristic of the workgirl class, but
singularly attractive in their neat black dresses and dainty
low-cut shoes. There was also much in evidence another type of
female whose extravagance of costume and boldness of manner loudly
proclaimed her ancient profession.</p>

<p>On either side of the boulevard were shops and cafés, mostly
cafés, with every now and then a <i>brasserie</i>, or beer hall.
Seated in front of these establishments, taking their ease as if
beer sampling constituted the only real interest in their lives,
were hundreds of students, reckless and dare-devil, and suggesting
almost anything except serious study. They all wore frock coats
and tall silk hats, and some of the latter were wonderful
specimens of the hatter's art. A few of the more eccentric
students had long hair down to their shoulders, and wore baggy
peg-top trousers of extravagant cut, which hung in loose folds
over their sharp-pointed boots. On their heads were queer plug
hats with flat brims.</p>

<p>Shirley laughed outright and regretted that she did not have
her kodak to take back to America some idea of their grotesque
appearance, and she listened with amused interest as Jefferson
explained that these men
<a class="pagebreak" name="page84" id="page84" title="84"></a>
were notorious <i>poseurs</i>, aping the dress and manners of the
old-time student as he flourished in the days of Randolph and Mimi
and the other immortal characters of Murger's Bohemia. Nobody took
them seriously except themselves, and for the most part they were
bad rhymesters of decadent verse. Shirley was astonished to see so
many of them busily engaged smoking cigarettes and imbibing
glasses of a pale-green beverage, which Jefferson told her was
absinthe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do they read?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;When do they
attend lectures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; laughed Jefferson, &ldquo;only the
old-fashioned students take their studies seriously. Most of the
men you see there are from the provinces, seeing Paris for the
first time, and having their fling. Incidentally they are studying
life. When they have sown their wild oats and learned all about
life&mdash;provided they are still alive and have any money
left&mdash;they will begin to study books. You would be surprised
to know how many of these young men, who have been sent to the
University at a cost of goodness knows what sacrifices, return to
their native towns in a few months wrecked in body and mind,
without having once set foot in a lecture room, and, in fact,
having done nothing except inscribe their names on the
rolls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley was glad she knew no such men, and if she
<a class="pagebreak" name="page85" id="page85" title="85"></a>
ever married and had a son she would pray God to spare her that
grief and humiliation. She herself knew something about the
sacrifices parents make to secure a college education for their
children. Her father had sent her to Vassar. She was a product of
the much-sneered-at higher education for women, and all her life
she would be grateful for the advantages given her. Her liberal
education had broadened her outlook on life and enabled her to
accomplish the little she had. When she graduated her father had
left her free to follow her own inclinations. She had little taste
for social distractions, and still she could not remain idle. For
a time she thought of teaching to occupy her mind, but she knew
she lacked the necessary patience, and she could not endure the
drudgery of it, so, having won honors at college in English
composition, she determined to try her hand at literature. She
wrote a number of essays and articles on a hundred different
subjects which she sent to the magazines, but they all came back
with politely worded excuses for their rejection. But Shirley kept
right on. She knew she wrote well; it must be that her subjects
were not suitable. So she adopted new tactics, and persevered
until one day came a letter of acceptance from the editor of one
of the minor magazines. They would take the article
offered&mdash;a sketch
<a class="pagebreak" name="page86" id="page86" title="86"></a>
of college life&mdash;and as many more in similar vein as Miss
Rossmore could write. This success had been followed by other
acceptances and other commissions, until at the present time she
was a well-known writer for the leading publications. Her great
ambition had been to write a book, and &ldquo;The American
Octopus,&rdquo; published under an assumed name, was the
result.</p>

<p>The cab stopped suddenly in front of beautiful gilded gates. It
was the Luxembourg, and through the tall railings they caught a
glimpse of well-kept lawns, splashing fountains and richly dressed
children playing. From the distance came the stirring strains of a
brass band.</p>

<p>The coachman drove up to the curb and Jefferson jumped down,
assisting Shirley to alight. In spite of Shirley's protest
Jefferson insisted on paying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Combien?</i>&rdquo; he asked the <i>cocher</i>.</p>

<p>The jehu, a surly, thick-set man with a red face and small,
cunning eyes like a ferret, had already sized up his fares for two
<i>sacré</i> foreigners whom it would be flying in the face of
Providence not to cheat, so with unblushing effrontery he
answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Dix francs, Monsieur!</i>&rdquo; And he held up ten
fingers by way of illustration.</p>

<p>Jefferson was about to hand up a ten-franc piece when Shirley
indignantly interfered. She would not
<a class="pagebreak" name="page87" id="page87" title="87"></a>
submit to such an imposition. There was a regular tariff and she
would pay that and nothing more. So, in better French than was at
Jefferson's command, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten francs? <i>Pourquoi dix francs?</i> I took your cab
by the hour. It is exactly two hours. That makes four
francs.&rdquo; Then to Jefferson she added: &ldquo;Give him a
franc for a <i>pourboire</i>&mdash;that makes five francs
altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson, obedient to her superior wisdom, held out a
five-franc piece, but the driver shrugged his shoulders
disdainfully. He saw that the moment had come to bluster so he
descended from his box fully prepared to carry out his bluff. He
started in to abuse the two Americans whom in his ignorance he
took for English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you <i>sale Anglais</i>! You come to France to cheat
the poor Frenchman. You make me work all afternoon and then pay me
nothing. Not with this coco! I know my rights and I'll get them,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this was hurled at them in a patois French, almost
unintelligible to Shirley, and wholly so to Jefferson. All he
knew was that the fellow's attitude was becoming unbearably
insolent and he stepped forward with a gleam in his eye that might
have startled the man had he not been so busy shaking his fist at
Shirley.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page88" id="page88" title="88"></a>
But she saw Jefferson's movement and laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Mr. Ryder&mdash;no scandal, please. Look, people
are beginning to come up! Leave him to me. I know how to manage
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this the daughter of a United States Supreme Court judge
proceeded to lay down the law to the representative of the most
lazy and irresponsible class of men ever let loose in the streets
of a civilised community. Speaking with an air of authority, she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here, my man, we have no time to bandy words
here with you. I took your cab at 3.30. It is now 5.30. That makes
two hours. The rate is two francs an hour, or four francs in all.
We offer you five francs, and this includes a franc
<i>pourboire</i>. If this settlement does not suit you we will get
into your cab and you will drive us to the nearest police-station
where the argument can be continued.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man's jaw dropped. He was obviously outclassed. These
foreigners knew the law as well as he did. He had no desire to
accept Shirley's suggestion of a trip to the police-station, where
he knew he would get little sympathy, so, grumbling and giving
vent under his breath to a volley of strange oaths, he grabbed
viciously at the five-franc piece Jefferson held out and, mounting
his box, drove off.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page89" id="page89" title="89"></a>
<p>Proud of their victory, they entered the gardens, following the
sweet-scented paths until they came to where the music was. The
band of an infantry regiment was playing, and a large crowd had
gathered. Many people were sitting on the chairs provided for
visitors for the modest fee of two sous; others were promenading
round and round a great circle having the musicians in its centre.
The dense foliage of the trees overhead afforded a perfect shelter
from the hot rays of the sun, and the place was so inviting and
interesting, so cool and so full of sweet perfumes and sounds,
appealing to and satisfying the senses, that Shirley wished they
had more time to spend there. She was very fond of a good brass
band, especially when heard in the open air. They were playing
Strauss's <i>Blue Danube</i>, and the familiar strains of the
delightful waltz were so infectious that both were seized by a
desire to get up and dance.</p>

<p>There was constant amusement, too, watching the crowd, with its
many original and curious types. There were serious college
professors, with gold-rimmed spectacles, buxom <i>nounous</i> in
their uniform cloaks and long ribbon streamers, nicely dressed
children romping merrily but not noisily, more queer-looking
students in shabby frock coats, tight at the waist, trousers too
short, and comical hats, stylishly
<a class="pagebreak" name="page90" id="page90" title="90"></a>
dressed women displaying the latest fashions, brilliantly
uniformed army officers strutting proudly, dangling their
swords&mdash;an attractive and interesting crowd, so different,
thought the two Americans, from the cheap, evil-smelling,
ill-mannered mob of aliens that invades their own Central Park the
days when there is music, making it a nuisance instead of a
pleasure. Here everyone belonged apparently to the better class;
the women and children were richly and fashionably dressed, the
officers looked smart in their multi-coloured uniforms, and, no
matter how one might laugh at the students, there was an
atmosphere of good-breeding and refinement everywhere which
Shirley was not accustomed to see in public places at home. A
sprinkling of workmen and people of the poorer class were to be
seen here and there, but they were in the decided minority.
Shirley, herself a daughter of the Revolution, was a staunch
supporter of the immortal principles of Democracy and of the
equality of man before the law. But all other talk of equality was
the greatest sophistry and charlatanism. There could be no real
equality so long as some people were cultured and refined and
others were uneducated and vulgar. Shirley believed in an
aristocracy of brains and soap. She insisted that no clean person,
no matter how good a democrat, should be expected to sit
<a class="pagebreak" name="page91" id="page91" title="91"></a>
close in public places to persons who were not on speaking terms
with the bath-tub. In America this foolish theory of a democracy,
which insists on throwing all classes, the clean and the unclean,
promiscuously together, was positively revolting, making
travelling in the public vehicles almost impossible, and it was
not much better in the public parks. In France&mdash;also a
Republic&mdash;where they likewise paraded conspicuously the
clap-trap &ldquo;Egalité, Fraternité,&rdquo; they managed these
things far better. The French lower classes knew their place. They
did not ape the dress, nor frequent the resorts of those above
them in the social scale. The distinction between the classes was
plainly and properly marked, yet this was not antagonistic to the
ideal of true democracy; it had not prevented the son of a peasant
from becoming President of the French Republic. Each district in
Paris had its own amusement, its own theatres, its own parks. It
was not a question of capital refusing to fraternize with labour,
but the very natural desire of persons of refinement to mingle
with clean people rather than to rub elbows with the Great
Unwashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't it delightful here?&rdquo; said Shirley. &ldquo;I
could stay here forever, couldn't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you&mdash;yes,&rdquo; answered Jefferson, with a
significant smile.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page92" id="page92" title="92"></a>
<p>Shirley tried to look angry. She strictly discouraged these
conventional, sentimental speeches which constantly flung her sex
in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you know I don't like you to talk that way, Mr.
Ryder. It's most undignified. Please be sensible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite subdued, Jefferson relapsed into a sulky silence.
Presently he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn't call me Mr. Ryder. I meant to ask
you this before.
<a name="insquote10" id="insquote10"></a>
You know very well that you've no great love for the name, and if
you persist you'll end by including me in your hatred of the hero
of your book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley looked at him with amused curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What do you
want me to call you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; he stammered, rather
intimidated by this self-possessed young woman who looked him
calmly through and through. &ldquo;Why not call me Jefferson? Mr.
Ryder is so formal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley laughed outright, a merry, unrestrained peal of honest
laughter, which made the passers-by turn their heads and smile,
too, commenting the while on the stylish appearance of the two
Americans whom they took for sweethearts. After all, reasoned
Shirley, he was right. They had been together now nearly
<a class="pagebreak" name="page93" id="page93" title="93"></a>
every hour in the day for over a month. It was absurd to call him
Mr. Ryder. So, addressing him with mock gravity, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're right, Mr. Ryder&mdash;I mean Jefferson. You're
quite right. You are Jefferson from this time on, only
remember&rdquo;&mdash;here she shook her gloved finger at him
warningly&mdash;&ldquo;mind you behave yourself! No more such
sentimental speeches as you made just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson beamed. He felt at least two inches taller, and at
that moment he would not have changed places with any one in the
world. To hide the embarrassment his gratification caused him he
pulled out his watch and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it's a quarter past six. We shall have all we can
do to get back to the hotel and dress for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley rose at once, although loath to leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no idea it was so late,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;How the time flies!&rdquo; Then mockingly she added:
&ldquo;Come, Jefferson&mdash;be a good boy and find a
cab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed out of the Gardens by the gate facing the Théâtre
de l'Odéon, where there was a long string of <i>fiacres</i> for
hire. They got into one and in fifteen minutes they were back at
the Grand Hotel.</p>

<a name="typo2" id="typo2"></a>
<p>At the office they told Shirley that her aunt had already come
in and gone to her room, so she hurried
<a class="pagebreak" name="page94" id="page94" title="94"></a>
upstairs to dress for dinner while Jefferson proceeded to the
Hotel de l'Athénée on the same mission. He had still twenty-five
minutes before dinner time, and he needed only ten minutes for a
wash and to jump into his dress suit, so, instead of going
directly to his hotel, he sat down at the Café de la Paix. He was
thirsty, and calling for a vermouth <i>frappé</i> he told the
<i>garçon</i> to bring him also the American papers.</p>

<p>The crowd on the boulevard was denser than ever. The business
offices and some of the shops were closing, and a vast army of
employés, homeward bound, helped to swell the sea of humanity that
pushed this way and that.</p>

<p>But Jefferson had no eyes for the crowd. He was thinking of
Shirley. What singular, mysterious power had this girl acquired
over him? He, who had scoffed at the very idea of marriage only a
few months before, now desired it ardently, anxiously! Yes, that
was what his life lacked&mdash;such a woman to be his companion
and helpmate! He loved her&mdash;there was no doubt of that. His
every thought, waking and sleeping, was of her, all his plans for
the future included her. He would win her if any man could. But
did she care for him? Ah, that was the cruel, torturing
uncertainty! She appeared cold and indifferent, but perhaps
<a class="pagebreak" name="page95" id="page95" title="95"></a>
she was only trying him. Certainly she did not seem to dislike
him.</p>

<p>The waiter returned with the vermouth and the newspapers. All
he could find were the London <i>Times</i>, which he pronounced
T-e-e-m-s, and some issues of the <i>New York Herald</i>. The
papers were nearly a month old, but he did not care for that.
Jefferson idly turned over the pages of the <i>Herald</i>. His
thoughts were still running on Shirley, and he was paying little
attention to what he was reading. Suddenly, however, his eyes
rested on a headline which made him sit up with a start. It read
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>JUDGE ROSSMORE IMPEACHED</h4>
<h5>JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT TO BE TRIED ON
BRIBERY CHARGES</h5>
</blockquote>

<p>The despatch, which was dated Washington two weeks back, went
on to say that serious charges affecting the integrity of Judge
Rossmore had been made the subject of Congressional inquiry, and
that the result of the inquiry was so grave that a demand for
impeachment would be at once sent to the Senate. It added that
the charges grew out of the recent decision in the Great
Northwestern Mining Company case, it being alleged that Judge
Rossmore had accepted
<a class="pagebreak" name="page96" id="page96" title="96"></a>
a large sum of money on condition of his handing down a decision
favourable to the company.</p>

<p>Jefferson was thunderstruck. He read the despatch over again to
make sure there was no mistake. No, it was very plain&mdash;Judge
Rossmore of Madison Avenue. But how preposterous, what a calumny!
The one judge on the bench at whom one could point and say with
absolute conviction: &ldquo;There goes an honest man!&rdquo; And
this judge was to be tried on a charge of bribery! What could be
the meaning of it? Something terrible must have happened since
Shirley's departure from home, that was certain. It meant her
immediate return to the States and, of course, his own. He would
see what could be done. He would make his father use his great
influence. But how could he tell Shirley? Impossible, he could
not! She would not believe him if he did. She would probably hear
from home in some other way. They might cable. In any case he
would say nothing yet. He paid for his vermouth and hurried away
to his hotel to dress.</p>

<p>It was just striking seven when he re-entered the courtyard of
the Grand Hotel. Shirley and Mrs. Blake were waiting for him.
Jefferson suggested having dinner at the Café de Paris, but
Shirley objected that as the weather was warm it would be more
pleasant to dine in the open air, so they finally decided
<a class="pagebreak" name="page97" id="page97" title="97"></a>
on the Pavilion d'Armonville where there was music and where they
could have a little table to themselves in the garden.</p>

<p>They drove up the stately Champs Elysées, past the monumental
Arc de Triomphe, and from there down to the Bois. All were
singularly quiet. Mrs. Blake was worrying about her new gown,
Shirley was tired, and Jefferson could not banish from his mind
the terrible news he had just read. He avoided looking at Shirley
until the latter noticed it and thought she must have offended him
in some way. She was more sorry than she would have him know, for,
with all her apparent coldness, Jefferson was rapidly becoming
very indispensable to her happiness.</p>

<p>They dined sumptuously and delightfully with all the luxury of
surroundings and all the delights of cooking that the French
culinary art can perfect. A single glass of champagne had put
Shirley in high spirits and she had tried hard to communicate some
of her good humour to Jefferson who, despite all her efforts,
remained quiet and preoccupied. Finally losing patience she asked
him bluntly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jefferson, what's the matter with you to-night? You've
been sulky as a bear all evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pleased to see she had not forgotten their compact
<a class="pagebreak" name="page98" id="page98" title="98"></a>
of the afternoon in regard to his name, Jefferson relaxed somewhat
and said apologetically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I've been feeling a bit seedy lately. I
think I need another sea voyage. That's the only time when I feel
really first-class&mdash;when I'm on the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mention of the sea started Shirley to talk about her future
plans. She wasn't going back to America until September. She had
arranged to make a stay of three weeks in London and then she
would be free. Some friends of hers from home, a man and his wife
who owned a steam yacht, were arranging a trip to the
Mediterranean, including a run over to Cairo. They had asked her
and Mrs. Blake to go and she was sure they would ask Jefferson,
too. Would he go?</p>

<p>There was no way out of it. Jefferson tried to work up some
enthusiasm for this yachting trip, which he knew very well could
never come off, and it cut him to the heart to see this poor girl
joyously making all these preparations and plans, little dreaming
of the domestic calamity which at that very moment was hanging
over her head.</p>

<blockquote class="central">&ldquo;Father, I've changed my mind,
I'm not going away.&rdquo;&mdash;Act II.</blockquote>

<p>It was nearly ten o'clock when they had finished. They sat a
little longer listening to the gipsy music, weird and barbaric.
Very pointedly, Shirley remarked:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page99" id="page99" title="99"></a>
<p>&ldquo;I for one preferred the music this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired Jefferson, ignoring the petulant
note in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you were more amiable!&rdquo; she retorted
rather crossly.</p>

<p>This was their first misunderstanding, but Jefferson said
nothing. He could not tell her the thoughts and fears that had
been haunting him all night. Soon afterward they re-entered their
cab and returned to the boulevards which were ablaze with light
and gaiety. Jefferson suggested going somewhere else, but Mrs.
Blake was tired and Shirley, now quite irritated at what she
considered Jefferson's unaccountable unsociability, declined
somewhat abruptly. But she could never remain angry long, and when
they said good-night she whispered demurely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you cross with me, Jeff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned his head away and she saw that his face was
singularly drawn and grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cross&mdash;no. Good-night. God bless you!&rdquo; he
said, hoarsely gulping down a lump that rose in his throat. Then
grasping her hand he hurried away.</p>

<p>Completely mystified, Shirley and her companion turned to the
office to get the key of their room. As the man handed it to
Shirley he passed her also a cablegram which had just come. She
changed colour.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page100" id="page100" title="100"></a>
She did not like telegrams. She always had a dread of them, for
with her sudden news was usually bad news. Could this, she
thought, explain Jefferson's strange behaviour? Trembling, she
tore open the envelope and read:</p>

<blockquote class="central"><i>Come home at once,</i></blockquote>
<blockquote class="signature"><i>Mother.</i></blockquote>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page101" id="page101" title="101"></a>
<a name="chapter5" id="chapter5"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>Rolling, tumbling, splashing, foaming water as far as the eye
could reach in every direction. A desolate waste, full of life,
movement and colour, extending to the bleak horizon and like a
vast ploughed field cut up into long and high liquid ridges, all
scurrying in one direction in serried ranks and with incredible
speed as if pursued by a fearful and unseen enemy. Serenely yet
boisterously, gracefully yet resistlessly, the endless waves
passed on&mdash;some small, others monstrous, with fleecy white
combs rushing down their green sides like toy Niagaras and with a
seething, boiling sound as when flame touches water. They went by
in a stately, never ending procession, going nowhere, coming from
nowhere, but full of dignity and importance, their breasts heaving
with suppressed rage because there was nothing in their path that
they might destroy. The dancing, leaping water reflected every
shade and tint&mdash;now a rich green, then a deep blue and again
a dirty gray as the sun hid for a moment behind a cloud, and as a
gust of wind caught the top of the combers decapitating
<a class="pagebreak" name="page102" id="page102" title="102"></a>
them at one mad rush, the spray was dashed high in the air,
flashing out all the prismatic colours. Here and yonder, the
white caps rose, disappeared and came again, and the waves grew
and then diminished in size. Then others rose, towering, became
larger, majestic, terrible; the milk-like comb rose proudly,
soared a brief moment, then fell ignominiously, and the wave
diminished passed on humiliated. Over head, a few scattered cirrus
clouds flitted lazily across the blue dome of heaven, while a
dozen Mother Carey chickens screamed hoarsely as they circled in
the air. The strong and steady western breeze bore on its powerful
pinions the sweet and eternal music of the wind and sea.</p>

<p>Shirley stood at the rail under the bridge of the ocean
greyhound that was carrying her back to America with all the speed
of which her mighty engines were capable. All day and all night,
half naked stokers, so grimed with oil and coal dust as to lose
the slightest semblance to human beings, feverishly shovelled
coal, throwing it rapidly and evenly over roaring furnaces kept at
a fierce white heat. The vast boilers, shaken by the titanic
forces generating in their cavern-like depths, sent streams of
scalding, hissing steam through a thousand valves, cylinders and
pistons, turning wheels and cranks as it
<a class="pagebreak" name="page103" id="page103" title="103"></a>
distributed the tremendous power which was driving the steel
monster through the seas at the prodigious speed of four hundred
miles in the twenty-four hours. Like a pulsating heart in some
living thing, the mammoth engines throbbed and panted, and the
great vessel groaned and creaked as she rose and fell to the heavy
swell, and again lurched forward in obedience to each fresh
propulsion from her fast spinning screws. Out on deck, volumes of
dense black smoke were pouring from four gigantic smoke stacks and
spread out in the sky like some endless cinder path leading back
over the course the ship had taken.</p>

<p>They were four days out from port. Two days more and they would
sight Sandy Hook, and Shirley would know the worst. She had caught
the North German Lloyd boat at Cherbourg two days after receiving
the cablegram from New York. Mrs. Blake had insisted on coming
along in spite of her niece's protests. Shirley argued that she
had crossed alone when coming; she could go back the same way.
Besides, was not Mr. Ryder returning home on the same ship? He
would be company and protection both. But Mrs. Blake was bent on
making the voyage. She had not seen her sister for many years
and, moreover, this sudden return to America had upset her own
plans. She was a poor sailor, yet she loved the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page104" id="page104" title="104"></a>
ocean and this was a good excuse for a long trip. Shirley was too
exhausted with worry to offer further resistance and by great good
luck the two women had been able to secure at the last moment a
cabin to themselves amidships. Jefferson, less fortunate, was
compelled, to his disgust, to share a stateroom with another
passenger, a fat German brewer who was returning to Cincinnati,
and who snored so loud at night that even the thumping of the
engines was completely drowned by his eccentric nasal sounds.</p>

<p>The alarming summons home and the terrible shock she had
experienced the following morning when Jefferson showed her the
newspaper article with its astounding and heart rending news about
her father had almost prostrated Shirley. The blow was all the
greater for being so entirely unlooked for. That the story was
true she could not doubt. Her mother would not have cabled except
under the gravest circumstances. What alarmed Shirley still more
was that she had no direct news of her father. For a moment her
heart stood still&mdash;suppose the shock of this shameful
accusation had killed him? Her blood froze in her veins, she
clenched her fists and dug her nails into her flesh as she thought
of the dread possibility that she had looked upon him in life for
the last time. She remembered his last kind words when he
<a class="pagebreak" name="page105" id="page105" title="105"></a>
came to the steamer to see her off, and his kiss when he said
good-bye and she had noticed a tear of which he appeared to be
ashamed. The hot tears welled up in her own eyes and coursed
unhindered down her cheeks.</p>

<p>What could these preposterous and abominable charges mean? What
was this lie they had invented to ruin her father? That he had
enemies she well knew. What strong man had not? Indeed, his
proverbial honesty had made him feared by all evil-doers and on
one occasion they had gone so far as to threaten his life. This
new attack was more deadly than all&mdash;to sap and destroy his
character, to deliberately fabricate lies and calumnies which had
no foundation whatever. Of course, the accusation was absurd, the
Senate would refuse to convict him, the entire press would espouse
the cause of so worthy a public servant. Certainly, everything
would be done to clear his character. But what was being done? She
could do nothing but wait and wait. The suspense and anxiety were
awful.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a familiar step behind her, and Jefferson
joined her at the rail. The wind was due West and blowing half a
gale, so where they were standing&mdash;one of the most exposed
parts of the ship&mdash;it was difficult to keep one's feet, to
say nothing of hearing anyone speak. There was a heavy sea
running,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page106" id="page106" title="106"></a>
and each approaching wave looked big enough to engulf the vessel,
but as the mass of moving water reached the bow, the ship rose on
it, light and graceful as a bird, shook off the flying spray as a
cat shakes her fur after an unwelcome bath, and again drove
forward as steady and with as little perceptible motion as a
railway train. Shirley was a fairly good sailor and this kind of
weather did not bother her in the least, but when it got very
rough she could not bear the rolling and pitching and then all she
was good for was to lie still in her steamer chair with her eyes
closed until the water was calmer and the pitching ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's pretty windy here, Shirley,&rdquo; shouted
Jefferson, steadying himself against a stanchion. &ldquo;Don't you
want to walk a little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had begun to call her by her first name quite naturally, as
if it were a matter of course. Indeed, their relations had come to
be more like those of brother and sister than anything else.
Shirley was too much troubled over the news from home to have a
mind for other things, and in her distress she had turned to
Jefferson for advice and help as she would have looked to an elder
brother. He had felt this impulse to confide in him and consult
his opinion and it had pleased him more than he dared betray. He
had shown her all the sympathy of which his warm,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page107" id="page107" title="107"></a>
generous nature was capable, yet secretly he did not regret that
events had necessitated this sudden return home together on the
same ship. He was sorry for Judge Rossmore, of course, and there
was nothing he would not do on his return to secure a withdrawal
of the charges. That his father would use his influence he had no
doubt. But meantime he was selfish enough to be glad for the
opportunity it gave him to be a whole week alone with Shirley. No
matter how much one may be with people in city or country or even
when stopping at the same hotel or house, there is no place in the
world where two persons, especially when they are of the opposite
sex, can become so intimate as on shipboard. The reason is
obvious. The days are long and monotonous. There is nowhere to go,
nothing to see but the ocean, nothing to do but read, talk or
promenade. Seclusion in one's stuffy cabin is out of the question,
the public sitting rooms are noisy and impossible, only a steamer
chair on deck is comfortable and once there snugly wrapped up in a
rug it is surprising how quickly another chair makes its
appearance alongside and how welcome one is apt to make the
intruder.</p>

<p>Thus events combined with the weather conspired to bring
Shirley and Jefferson more closely together. The sea had been
rough ever since they
<a class="pagebreak" name="page108" id="page108" title="108"></a>
sailed, keeping Mrs. Blake confined to her stateroom almost
continuously. They were, therefore, constantly in one another's
company, and slowly, unconsciously, there was taking root in their
hearts the germ of the only real and lasting love&mdash;the love
born of something higher than mere physical attraction, the
nobler, more enduring affection that is born of mutual sympathy,
association and companionship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't it beautiful?&rdquo; exclaimed Shirley
ecstatically. &ldquo;Look at those great waves out there! See how
majestically they soar and how gracefully they fall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glorious!&rdquo; assented Jefferson sharing her
enthusiasm. &ldquo;There's nothing to compare with it. It's
Nature's grandest spectacle. The ocean is the only place on earth
that man has not defiled and spoiled. Those waves are the same
now as they were on the day of creation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the day of creation. You mean during the aeons of
time creation was evolving,&rdquo; corrected Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant that of course,&rdquo; assented Jefferson.
&ldquo;When one says &lsquo;day&rsquo; that is only a form of
speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not be accurate?&rdquo; persisted Shirley. &ldquo;It
was the use of that little word &lsquo;day&rsquo; which has given
the theologians so many sleepless nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a roguish twinkle in her eye. She well
<a class="pagebreak" name="page109" id="page109" title="109"></a>
knew that he thought as she did on metaphysical questions, but she
could not resist teasing him.</p>

<p>Like Jefferson, she was not a member of any church, although
her nature was deeply religious. Hers was the religion the soul
inculcates, not that which is learned by rote in the temple. She
was a Christian because she thought Christ the greatest figure in
world history, and also because her own conduct of life was
modelled upon Christian principles and virtues. She was religious
for religion's sake and not for public ostentation. The mystery of
life awed her and while her intelligence could not accept all the
doctrines of dogmatic religion she did not go so far as Jefferson,
who was a frank agnostic. She would not admit that we do not know.
The longings and aspirations of her own soul convinced her of the
existence of a Supreme Being, First Cause, Divine
Intelligence&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;which had brought
out of chaos the wonderful order of the universe. The human mind
was, indeed, helpless to conceive such a First Cause in any form
and lay prostrate before the Unknown, yet she herself was an
enthusiastic delver into scientific hypothesis and the teachings
of Darwin, Spencer, Haeckel had satisfied her intellect if they
had failed to content her soul. The theory of evolution as applied
to life on her own little planet appealed
<a class="pagebreak" name="page110" id="page110" title="110"></a>
strongly to her because it accounted plausibly for the presence of
man on earth. The process through which we had passed could be
understood by every intelligence. The blazing satellite,
violently detached from the parent sun starting on its
circumscribed orbit&mdash;that was the first stage, the gradual
subsidence of the flames and the cooling of the crust&mdash;the
second stage: the gases mingling and forming water which covered
the earth&mdash;the third stage; the retreating of the waters and
the appearance of the land&mdash;the fourth stage; the appearance
of vegetation and animal life&mdash;the fifth stage; then, after a
long interval and through constant evolution and change the
appearance of man, which was the sixth stage. What stages still to
come, who knows? This simple account given by science was, after
all, practically identical with the biblical legend!</p>

<p>It was when Shirley was face to face with Nature in her wildest
and most primitive aspects that this deep rooted religious feeling
moved her most strongly. At these times she felt herself another
being, exalted, sublimated, lifted from this little world with its
petty affairs and vanities up to dizzy heights. She had felt the
same sensation when for the first time she had viewed the glories
of the snow clad Matterhorn, she had felt it when on a summer's
night at sea she had sat on deck and watched with fascinated awe
the resplendent
<a class="pagebreak" name="page111" id="page111" title="111"></a>
radiance of the countless stars, she felt it now as she looked at
the foaming, tumbling waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so beautiful,&rdquo; she murmured as she turned to
walk. The ship was rolling a little and she took Jefferson's arm
to steady herself. Shirley was an athletic girl and had all the
ease and grace of carriage that comes of much tennis and golf
playing. Barely twenty-four years old, she was still in the first
flush of youth and health, and there was nothing she loved so much
as exercise and fresh air. After a few turns on deck, there was a
ruddy glow in her cheeks that was good to see and many an admiring
glance was cast at the young couple as they strode briskly up and
down past the double rows of elongated steamer chairs.</p>

<p>They had the deck pretty much to themselves. It was only four
o'clock, too early for the appetite-stimulating walk before
dinner, and their fellow passengers were basking in the sunshine,
stretched out on their chairs in two even rows like so many
mummies on exhibition. Some were reading, some were dozing. Two
or three were under the weather, completely prostrated, their
bilious complexion of a deathly greenish hue. At each new roll of
the ship, they closed their eyes as if resigned to the worst that
might happen and their immediate neighbours furtively eyed each of
their
<a class="pagebreak" name="page112" id="page112" title="112"></a>
movements as if apprehensive of what any moment might bring forth.
A few couples were flirting to their heart's content under the
friendly cover of the lifeboats which, as on most of the
transatlantic liners, were more useful in saving reputations than
in saving life. The deck steward was passing round tea and
biscuits, much to the disgust of the ill ones, but to the keen
satisfaction of the stronger stomached passengers who on shipboard
never seem to be able to get enough to eat and drink. On the
bridge, the second officer, a tall, handsome man with the points
of his moustache trained upwards à la Kaiser Wilhelm, was striding
back and forth, every now and then sweeping the horizon with his
glass and relieving the monotony of his duties by ogling the
better looking women passengers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Shirley!&rdquo; called out a voice from a heap of
rugs as Shirley and Jefferson passed the rows of chairs.</p>

<p>They stopped short and discovered Mrs. Blake ensconced in a
cozy corner, sheltered from the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, aunt Milly,&rdquo; exclaimed Shirley surprised.
&ldquo;I thought you were downstairs. I didn't think you could
stand this sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a little rougher than I care to have it,&rdquo;
responded Mrs. Blake with a wry grimace and putting
<a class="pagebreak" name="page113" id="page113" title="113"></a>
her hand to her breast as if to appease disturbing qualms.
&ldquo;It was so stuffy in the cabin I could not bear it. It's
more pleasant here but it's getting a little cool and I think I'll
go below. Where have you children been all afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson volunteered to explain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The children have been rhapsodizing over the beauties of
the ocean,&rdquo; he laughed. With a sly glance at Shirley, he
added, &ldquo;Your niece has been coaching me in
metaphysics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley shook her finger at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Jefferson, if you make fun of me I'll never talk
seriously with you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Wie geht es, meine damen?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley turned on hearing the guttural salutation. It was
Captain Hegermann, the commander of the ship, a big florid Saxon
with great bushy golden whiskers and a basso voice like Edouard de
Reszké. He was imposing in his smart uniform and gold braid and
his manner had the self-reliant, authoritative air usual in men
who have great responsibilities and are accustomed to command. He
was taking his afternoon stroll and had stopped to chat with his
lady passengers. He had already passed Mrs. Blake a dozen times
and not noticed her, but now her pretty niece was with her, which
altered the situation. He talked
<a class="pagebreak" name="page114" id="page114" title="114"></a>
to the aunt and looked at Shirley, much to the annoyance of
Jefferson, who muttered things under his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When shall we be in, captain?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Blake
anxiously, forgetting that this was one of the questions which
according to ship etiquette must never be asked of the
officers.</p>

<p>But as long as he could ignore Mrs. Blake and gaze at Shirley
Capt. Hegermann did not mind. He answered amiably:</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the rate we are going, we ought to sight Fire Island
sometime to-morrow evening. If we do, that will get us to our dock
about 11 o'clock Friday morning, I fancy.&rdquo; Then addressing
Shirley direct he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, fraulein, I hope you won't be glad the voyage
is over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley sighed and a worried, anxious look came into her
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain, I shall be very glad. It is not pleasure
that is bringing me back to America so soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain elevated his eyebrows. He was sorry the young lady
had anxieties to keep her so serious, and he hoped she would find
everything all right on her arrival. Then, politely saluting, he
passed on, only to halt again a few paces on where his bewhiskered
gallantry met with more encouragement.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page115" id="page115" title="115"></a>
<p>Mrs. Blake rose from her chair. The air was decidedly cooler,
she would go downstairs and prepare for dinner. Shirley said she
would remain on deck a little longer. She was tired of walking, so
when her aunt left them she took her chair and told Jefferson to
get another. He wanted nothing better, but before seating himself
he took the rugs and wrapped Shirley up with all the solicitude of
a mother caring for her first born. Arranging the pillow under her
head, he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that comfortable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded, smiling at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're a good boy, Jeff. But you'll spoil me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he stammered as he took another chair
and put himself by her side. &ldquo;As if any fellow wouldn't give
his boots to do a little job like that for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed to take no notice of the covert compliment. In
fact, she already took it as a matter of course that Jefferson was
very fond of her.</p>

<p>Did she love him? She hardly knew. Certainly she thought more
of him than of any other man she knew and she readily believed
that she could be with him for the rest of her life and like him
better every day. Then, too, they had become more intimate during
the last few days. This trouble, this unknown peril had
<a class="pagebreak" name="page116" id="page116" title="116"></a>
drawn them together. Yes, she would be sorry if she were to see
Jefferson paying attention to another woman. Was this love?
Perhaps.</p>

<p>These thoughts were running through her mind as they sat there
side by side isolated from the main herd of passengers, each
silent, watching through the open rail the foaming water as it
rushed past. Jefferson had been casting furtive glances at his
companion and as he noted her serious, pensive face he thought how
pretty she was. He wondered what she was thinking of and suddenly
inspired no doubt by the mysterious power that enables some people
to read the thoughts of others, he said abruptly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shirley, I can read your thoughts. You were thinking of
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was startled for a moment but immediately recovered her
self possession. It never occurred to her to deny it. She pondered
for a moment and then replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, Jeff, I was thinking of you. How did you
guess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned over her chair and took her hand. She made no
resistance. Her delicate, slender hand lay passively in his big
brown one and met his grasp frankly, cordially. He whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you thinking of me&mdash;good or
bad?&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page117" id="page117" title="117"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Good, of course. How could I think anything bad of
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned her eyes on him in wonderment. Then she went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was wondering how a girl could distinguish between the
feeling she has for a man she merely likes, and the feeling she
has for a man she loves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson bent eagerly forward so as to lose no word that might
fall from those coveted lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what category would I be placed?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't quite know,&rdquo; she answered, laughingly.
Then seriously, she added: &ldquo;Jeff, why should we act like
children? Your actions, more than your words, have told me that
you love me. I have known it all along. If I have appeared cold
and indifferent it is because&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because?&rdquo; echoed Jefferson anxiously, as if his
whole future depended on that reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I was not sure of myself. Would it be womanly or
honourable on my part to encourage you, unless I felt I
reciprocated your feelings? You are young, one day you will be
very rich, the whole world lies before you. There are plenty of
women who would willingly give you their love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; he burst out in vigorous protest,
&ldquo;it is you I want, Shirley, you alone.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page118" id="page118" title="118"></a>
<p>Grasping her hand more closely, he went on, passion vibrating
in every note of his voice. &ldquo;I love you, Shirley. I've loved
you from the very first evening I met you. I want you to be my
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley looked straight up into the blue eyes so eagerly bent
down on hers, so entreating in their expression, and in a gentle
voice full of emotion she answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jefferson, you have done me the greatest honour a man
can do a woman. Don't ask me to answer you now. I like you very
much&mdash;I more than like you. Whether it is love I feel for
you&mdash;that I have not yet determined. Give me time. My present
trouble and then my literary work&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; agreed Jefferson, &ldquo;that this is
hardly the time to speak of such matters. Your father has first
call on your attention. But as to your literary work. I do not
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply this. I am ambitious. I have had a little
success&mdash;just enough to crave for more. I realize that
marriage would put an extinguisher on all aspirations in that
direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is marriage so very commonplace?&rdquo; grumbled
Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not commonplace, but there is no room in marriage
for a woman having personal ambitions of her
<a class="pagebreak" name="page119" id="page119" title="119"></a>
own. Once married her duty is to her husband and her
children&mdash;not to herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but which is
likely to give you greater joy&mdash;a literary success or a happy
wifehood? When you have spent your best years and given the public
your best work they will throw you over for some new favorite.
You'll find yourself an old woman with nothing more substantial to
show as your life work than that questionable asset, a literary
reputation. How many literary reputations to-day conceal an aching
heart and find it difficult to make both ends meet? How different
with the woman who married young and obeys Nature's behest by
contributing her share to the process of evolution. Her life is
spent basking in the affection of her husband and the chubby
smiles of her dimpled babes, and when in the course of time she
finds herself in the twilight of her life, she has at her feet a
new generation of her own flesh and blood. Isn't that better than
a literary reputation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke so earnestly that Shirley looked at him in surprise.
She knew he was serious but she had not suspected that he thought
so deeply on these matters. Her heart told her that he was
uttering the true philosophy of the ages. She said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jefferson, you talk like a book. Perhaps you
<a class="pagebreak" name="page120" id="page120" title="120"></a>
are right, I have no wish to be a blue stocking and deserted in my
old age, far from it. But give me time to think. Let us first
ascertain the extent of this disaster which has overtaken my
father. Then if you still care for me and if I have not changed my
mind,&rdquo; here she glanced slyly at him, &ldquo;we will resume
our discussion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again she held out her hand which he had released.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a bargain?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a bargain,&rdquo; he murmured, raising the white
hand to his lips. A fierce longing rose within him to take her in
his arms and kiss passionately the mouth that lay temptingly near
his own, but his courage failed him. After all, he reasoned, he
had not yet the right.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they left the deck and went downstairs to
dress for dinner. That same evening they stood again at the rail
watching the mysterious phosphorescence as it sparkled in the
moonlight. Her thoughts travelling faster than the ship, Shirley
suddenly asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think Mr. Ryder will use his influence to
help my father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson set his jaw fast and the familiar Ryder gleam came
into his eyes as he responded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? My father is all powerful. He has made and
unmade judges and legislators and even
<a class="pagebreak" name="page121" id="page121" title="121"></a>
presidents. Why should he not be able to put a stop to these
preposterous proceedings? I will go to him directly we land and
we'll see what can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the time on shipboard had passed, Shirley alternately buoyed
up with hope and again depressed by the gloomiest forebodings. The
following night they passed Fire Island and the next day the huge
steamer dropped anchor at Quarantine.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page122" id="page122" title="122"></a>
<a name="chapter6" id="chapter6"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>A month had passed since the memorable meeting of the directors
of the Southern and Transcontinental Railroad in New York and
during that time neither John Burkett Ryder nor Judge Rossmore had
been idle. The former had immediately set in motion the machinery
he controlled in the Legislature at Washington, while the judge
neglected no step to vindicate himself before the public.</p>

<p>Ryder, for reasons of his own&mdash;probably because he wished
to make the blow the more crushing when it did fall&mdash;had
insisted on the proceedings at the board meeting being kept a
profound secret and some time elapsed before the newspapers got
wind of the coming Congressional inquiry. No one had believed the
stories about Judge Rossmore but now that a quasi-official seal
had been set on the current gossip, there was a howl of virtuous
indignation from the journalistic muck rakers. What was the
country coming to? they cried in double leaded type. After the
embezzling by life insurance officers, the rascality of the
railroads, the looting of city treasuries, the greed of the
Trusts,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page123" id="page123" title="123"></a>
the grafting of the legislators, had arisen a new and more serious
scandal&mdash;the corruption of the Judiciary. The last bulwark
of the nation had fallen, the country lay helpless at the mercy of
legalized sandbaggers. Even the judges were no longer to be
trusted, the most respected one among them all had been unable to
resist the tempter. The Supreme Court, the living voice of the
Constitution, was honeycombed with graft. Public life was rotten
to the core!</p>

<p>Neither the newspapers nor the public stopped to ascertain the
truth or the falsity of the charges against Judge Rossmore. It was
sufficient that the bribery story furnished the daily sensation
which newspaper editors and newspaper readers must have. The world
is ever more prompt to believe ill rather than good of a man, and
no one, except in Rossmore's immediate circle of friends,
entertained the slightest doubt of his guilt. It was common
knowledge that the &ldquo;big interests&rdquo; were behind the
proceedings, and that Judge Rossmore was a scapegoat, sacrificed
by the System because he had been blocking their game. If Rossmore
had really accepted the bribe, and few now believed him spotless,
he deserved all that was coming to him. Senator Roberts was very
active in Washington preparing the case against Judge Rossmore.
The latter being a democrat and &ldquo;the interests&rdquo;
controlling
<a class="pagebreak" name="page124" id="page124" title="124"></a>
a Republican majority in the House, it was a foregone conclusion
that the inquiry would be against him, and that a demand would at
once be made upon the Senate for his impeachment.</p>

<p>Almost prostrated by the misfortune which had so suddenly and
unexpectedly come upon him, Judge Rossmore was like a man
demented. His reason seemed to be tottering, he spoke and acted
like a man in a dream. Naturally he was entirely incapacitated for
work and he had applied to Washington to be temporarily relieved
from his judicial duties. He was instantly granted a leave of
absence and went at once to his home in Madison Avenue, where he
shut himself up in his library, sitting for hours at his desk
wrestling with documents and legal tomes in a pathetic endeavour
to find some way out, trying to elude this net in which unseen
hands had entangled him.</p>

<p>What an end to his career! To have struggled and achieved for
half a century, to have built up a reputation year by year, as a
man builds a house brick by brick, only to see the whole crumble
to his feet like dust! To have gained the respect of the country,
to have made a name as the most incorruptible of public servants
and now to be branded as a common bribe taker! Could he be
dreaming? It was too incredible! What would his daughter
say&mdash;his Shirley? Ah, the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page125" id="page125" title="125"></a>
thought of the expression of incredulity and wonder on her face
when she heard the news cut him to the heart like a knife thrust.
Yet, he mused, her very unwillingness to believe it should really
be his consolation. Ah, his wife and his child&mdash;they knew he
had been innocent of wrong doing. The very idea was ridiculous.
At most he had been careless. Yes, he was certainly to blame. He
ought to have seen the trap so carefully prepared and into which
he had walked as if blindfolded. That extra $50,000 worth of
stock, on which he had never received a cent interest, had been
the decoy in a carefully thought out plot. They, the plotters,
well knew how ignorant he was of financial matters and he had been
an easy victim. Who would believe his story that the stock had
been sent to him with a plausibly-worded letter to the effect that
it represented a bonus on his own investment? Now he came to think
of it, calmly and reasonably, he would not believe it himself. As
usual, he had mislaid or destroyed the secretary's letter and
there was only his word against the company's books to
substantiate what would appear a most improbable if not impossible
occurrence.</p>

<p>It was his conviction of his own good faith that made his
present dilemma all the more cruel. Had he really been a grafter,
had he really taken the stock
<a class="pagebreak" name="page126" id="page126" title="126"></a>
as a bribe he would not care so much, for then he would have
foreseen and discounted the chances of exposure. Yes, there was no
doubt possible. He was the victim of a conspiracy, there was an
organized plot to ruin him, to get him out of the way. The
&ldquo;interests&rdquo; feared him, resented his judicial
decisions and they had halted at nothing to accomplish their
purpose. How could he fight them back, what could he do to protect
himself? He had no proofs of a conspiracy, his enemies worked in
the dark, there was no way in which he could reach them or know
who they were.</p>

<p>He thought of John Burkett Ryder. Ah, he remembered now. Ryder
was the man who had recommended the investment in Alaskan stock.
Of course, why did he not think of it before? He recollected that
at the time he had been puzzled at receiving so much stock and he
had mentioned it to Ryder, adding that the secretary had told him
it was customary. Oh, why had he not kept the secretary's letter?
But Ryder would certainly remember it. He probably still had his
two letters in which he spoke of making the investment. If those
letters could be produced at the Congressional inquiry they would
clear him at once. So losing no time, and filled with renewed hope
he wrote to the Colossus a strong, manly letter which would
<a class="pagebreak" name="page127" id="page127" title="127"></a>
have melted an iceberg, urging Mr. Ryder to come forward now at
this critical time and clear him of this abominable charge, or in
any case to kindly return the two letters he must have in his
possession, as they would go far to help him at the trial. Three
days passed and no reply from Ryder. On the fourth came a polite
but frigid note from Mr. Ryder's private secretary. Mr. Ryder had
received Judge Rossmore's letter and in reply begged to state that
he had a vague recollection of some conversation with the judge in
regard to investments, but he did not think he had advised the
purchase of any particular stock, as that was something he never
did on principle, even with his most intimate friends. He had no
wish to be held accountable in case of loss, etc. As to the letter
which Judge Rossmore mentioned as having written to Mr. Ryder in
regard to having received more stock than he had bought, of that
Mr. Ryder had no recollection whatsoever. Judge Rossmore was
probably mistaken as to the identity of his correspondent. He
regretted he could not be of more service to Judge Rossmore, and
remained his very obedient servant.</p>

<p>It was very evident that no help was to be looked for in that
quarter. There was even decided hostility in Ryder's reply. Could
it be true that the financier was really behind these attacks upon
his character, was
<a class="pagebreak" name="page128" id="page128" title="128"></a>
it possible that one man merely to make more money would
deliberately ruin his fellow man whose hand he had grasped in
friendship? He had been unwilling to believe it when his friend
ex-judge Stott had pointed to Ryder as the author of all his
misfortunes, but this unsympathetic letter with its falsehoods,
its lies plainly written all over its face, was proof enough. Yes,
there was now no doubt possible. John Burkett Ryder was his enemy
and what an enemy! Many a man had committed suicide when he had
incurred the enmity of the Colossus. Judge Rossmore, completely
discouraged, bowed his head to the inevitable.</p>

<p>His wife, a nervous, sickly woman, was helpless to comfort or
aid him. She had taken their misfortune as a visitation of an
inscrutable Deity. She knew, of course, that her husband was
wholly innocent of the accusations brought against him and if his
character could be cleared and himself rehabilitated before the
world, she would be the first to rejoice. But if it pleased the
Almighty in His wisdom to sorely try her husband and herself and
inflict this punishment upon them it was not for the finite mind
to criticise the ways of Providence. There was probably some good
reason for the apparent cruelty and injustice of it which their
earthly understanding failed to grasp. Mrs. Rossmore found much
comfort in this philosophy,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page129" id="page129" title="129"></a>
which gave a satisfactory ending to both ends of the problem, and
she was upheld in her view by the rector of the church which she
had attended regularly each Sunday for the past five and twenty
years. Christian resignation in the hour of trial, submission to
the will of Heaven were, declared her spiritual adviser, the
fundamental principles of religion. He could only hope that Mrs.
Rossmore would succeed in imbuing her husband with her Christian
spirit. But when the judge's wife returned home and saw the keen
mental distress of the man who had been her companion for
twenty-five long years, the comforter in her sorrows, the joy and
pride of her young wifehood, she forgot all about her smug
churchly consoler, and her heart went out to her husband in a
spontaneous burst of genuine human sympathy. Yes, they must do
something at once. Where men had failed perhaps a woman could do
something. She wanted to cable at once for Shirley, who was
everything in their household&mdash;organizer, manager,
adviser&mdash;but the judge would not hear of it. No, his daughter
was enjoying her holiday in blissful ignorance of what had
occurred. He would not spoil it for her. They would see; perhaps
things would improve. But he sent for his old friend ex-Judge
Stott.</p>

<p>They were life-long friends, having become acquainted
<a class="pagebreak" name="page130" id="page130" title="130"></a>
nearly thirty years ago at the law school, at the time when both
were young men about to enter on a public career. Stott, who was
Rossmore's junior, had begun as a lawyer in New York and soon
acquired a reputation in criminal practice. He afterwards became
assistant district attorney and later, when a vacancy occurred in
the city magistrature, he was successful in securing the
appointment. On the bench he again met his old friend Rossmore and
the two men once more became closely intimate. The regular court
hours, however, soon palled on a man of Judge Stott's nervous
temperament and it was not long before he retired to take up once
more his criminal practice. He was still a young man, not yet
fifty, and full of vigor and fight. He had a blunt manner but his
heart was in the right place, and he had a record as clean as his
close shaven face. He was a hard worker, a brilliant speaker and
one of the cleverest cross-examiners at the bar. This was the man
to whom Judge Rossmore naturally turned for legal assistance.</p>

<p>Stott was out West when he first heard of the proceedings
against his old friend, and this indignity put upon the only
really honest man in public life whom he knew, so incensed him
that he was already hurrying back to his aid when the summons
reached him.</p>

<p>Meantime, a fresh and more serious calamity had
<a class="pagebreak" name="page131" id="page131" title="131"></a>
overwhelmed Judge Rossmore. Everything seemed to combine to break
the spirit of this man who had dared defy the power of organized
capital. Hardly had the news of the Congressional inquiry been
made public, than the financial world was startled by an
extraordinary slump in Wall Street. There was nothing in the news
of the day to justify a decline, but prices fell and fell. The
bears had it all their own way, the big interests hammered stocks
all along the line, &ldquo;coppers&rdquo; especially being the
object of attack. The market closed feverishly and the next day
the same tactics were pursued. From the opening, on selling orders
coming from no one knew where, prices fell to nothing, a stampede
followed and before long it became a panic. Pandemonium reigned on
the floor of the Stock Exchange. White faced, dishevelled brokers
shouted and struggled like men possessed to execute the orders of
their clients. Big financial houses, which stood to lose millions
on a falling market, rallied and by rush orders to buy, attempted
to stem the tide, but all to no purpose. One firm after another
went by the board unable to weather the tempest, until just before
closing time, the stock ticker announced the failure of the Great
Northwestern Mining Co. The drive in the market had been
principally directed against its securities, and after vainly
endeavoring to
<a class="pagebreak" name="page132" id="page132" title="132"></a>
check the bear raid, it had been compelled to declare itself
bankrupt. It was heavily involved, assets nil, stock almost
worthless. It was probable that the creditors would not see ten
cents on the dollar. Thousands were ruined and Judge Rossmore
among them. All the savings of a lifetime&mdash;nearly $55,000
were gone. He was practically penniless, at a time when he needed
money most. He still owned his house in Madison Avenue, but that
would have to go to settle with his creditors. By the time
everything was paid there would only remain enough for a modest
competence. As to his salary, of course he could not touch that
so long as this accusation was hanging over his head. And if he
were impeached it would stop altogether. The salary, therefore,
was not to be counted on. They must manage as best they could and
live more cheaply, taking a small house somewhere in the outskirts
of the city where he could prepare his case quietly without
attracting attention.</p>

<p>Stott thought this was the best thing they could do and he
volunteered to relieve his friend by taking on his own hands all
the arrangements of the sale of the house and furniture, which
offer the judge accepted only too gladly. Meantime, Mrs. Rossmore
went to Long Island to see what could be had, and she found at the
little village of Massapequa just what they were
<a class="pagebreak" name="page133" id="page133" title="133"></a>
looking for&mdash;a commodious, neatly-furnished two-story cottage
at a modest rental. Of course, it was nothing like what they had
been accustomed to, but it was clean and comfortable, and as Mrs.
Rossmore said, rather tactlessly, beggars cannot be choosers.
Perhaps it would not be for long. Instant possession was to be
had, so deposit was paid on the spot and a few days later the
Rossmores left their mansion on Madison Avenue and took up their
residence in Massapequa, where their advent created quite a
fluster in local social circles.</p>

<p>Massapequa is one of the thousand and one flourishing
communities scattered over Long Island, all of which are
apparently modelled after the same pattern. Each is an exact
duplicate of its neighbour in everything except the name&mdash;the
same untidy railroad station, the same sleepy stores, the same
attractive little frame residences, built for the most part on the
&ldquo;Why pay Rent? Own your own Home&rdquo; plan. A healthy boom
in real estate imparts plenty of life to them all and Massapequa
is particularly famed as being the place where the cat jumped to
when Manhattan had to seek an outlet for its congested population
and ever-increasing army of home seekers. Formerly large tracts of
flat farm lands, only sparsely shaded by trees, Massapequa, in
common with other villages of its kind,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page134" id="page134" title="134"></a>
was utterly destitute of any natural attractions. There was the
one principal street leading to the station, with a few scattered
stores on either side, a church and a bank. Happily, too, for
those who were unable to survive the monotony of the place, it
boasted of a pretty cemetery. There were also a number of
attractive cottages with spacious porches hung with honeysuckle
and of these the Rossmores occupied one of the less pretentious
kind.</p>

<p>But although Massapequa, theoretically speaking, was situated
only a stone's throw from the metropolis, it might have been
situated in the Great Sahara so far as its inhabitants took any
active interest in the doings of gay Gotham. Local happenings
naturally had first claim upon Massapequa's attention&mdash;the
prowess of the local baseball team, Mrs. Robinson's tea party and
the highly exciting sessions of the local Pinochle Club furnishing
food for unlimited gossip and scandal. The newspapers reached the
village, of course, but only the local news items aroused any real
interest, while the women folk usually restricted their readings
to those pages devoted to Daily Hints for the Home, Mrs. Sayre's
learned articles on Health and Beauty and Fay Stanton's Daily
Fashions. It was not surprising, therefore, that the fame of Judge
Rossmore and the scandal in which he was at present involved had
not
<a class="pagebreak" name="page135" id="page135" title="135"></a>
penetrated as far as Massapequa and that the natives were
considerably mystified as to who the new arrivals in their midst
might be.</p>

<p>Stott had been given a room in the cottage so that he might be
near at hand to work with the judge in the preparation of the
defence, and he came out from the city every evening. It was now
June. The Senate would not take action until it convened in
December, but there was a lot of work to be done and no time to be
lost.</p>

<p>The evening following the day of their arrival they were
sitting on the porch enjoying the cool evening air after dinner.
The judge was smoking. He was not a slave to the weed, but he
enjoyed a quiet pipe after meals, claiming that it quieted his
nerves and enabled him to think more clearly. Besides, it was
necessary to keep at bay the ubiquitous Long Island mosquito. Mrs.
Rossmore had remained for a moment in the dining-room to admonish
Eudoxia, their new and only maid-of-all-work, not to wreck too
much of the crockery when she removed the dinner dishes. Suddenly
Stott, who was perusing an evening paper, asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, where's your daughter? Does she know of this
radical change in your affairs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Rossmore started. By what mysterious
<a class="pagebreak" name="page136" id="page136" title="136"></a>
agency had this man penetrated his own most intimate thoughts? He
was himself thinking of Shirley that very moment, and by some
inexplicable means&mdash;telepathy modern psychologists called
it&mdash;the thought current had crossed to Stott, whose mind,
being in full sympathy, was exactly attuned to receive it.
Removing the pipe from his mouth the judge replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shirley's in Paris. Poor girl, I hadn't the heart to
tell her. She has no idea of what's happened. I didn't want to
spoil her holiday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. Then, after a few more puffs he
added confidentially in a low tone, as if he did not care for his
wife to hear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is, Stott, I couldn't bear to have her return
now. I couldn't look my own daughter in the face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sound as of a great sob which he had been unable to control
cut short his speech. His eyes filled with tears and he began to
smoke furiously as if ashamed of this display of emotion. Stott,
blowing his nose with suspicious vigor, replied soothingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn't talk like that. Everything will come out all
right, of course. But I think you are wrong not to have told your
daughter. Her place is here at your side. She ought to be told
even if only in justice
<a class="pagebreak" name="page137" id="page137" title="137"></a>
to her. If you don't tell her someone else will, or, what's worse,
she'll hear of it through the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I never thought of that!&rdquo; exclaimed the judge,
visibly perturbed at the suggestion about the newspapers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you agree with me?&rdquo; demanded Stott,
appealing to Mrs. Rossmore, who emerged from the house at that
instant. &ldquo;Don't you think your daughter should be informed
of what has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most assuredly I do,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Rossmore
determinedly. &ldquo;The judge wouldn't hear of it, but I took the
law into my own hands. I've cabled for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cabled for Shirley?&rdquo; cried the judge
incredulously. He was so unaccustomed to seeing his ailing,
vacillating wife do anything on her own initiative and
responsibility that it seemed impossible. &ldquo;You cabled for
Shirley?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Rossmore triumphantly and
secretly pleased that for once in her life she had asserted
herself. &ldquo;I cabled yesterday. I simply couldn't bear it
alone any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; inquired the judge
apprehensively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just told her to come home at once. To-morrow; we
ought to get an answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stott meantime had been figuring on the time of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page138" id="page138" title="138"></a>
Shirley's probable arrival. If the cablegram had been received in
Paris the previous evening it would be too late to catch the
French boat. The North German Lloyd steamer was the next to leave
and it touched at Cherbourg. She would undoubtedly come on that.
In a week at most she would be here. Then it became a question as
to who should go to meet her at the dock. The judge could not go,
that was certain. It would be too much of an ordeal. Mrs. Rossmore
did not know the lower part of the city well, and had no
experience in meeting ocean steamships. There was only one way
out&mdash;would Stott go? Of course he would and he would bring
Shirley back with him to Massapequa. So during the next few days
while Stott and the judge toiled preparing their case, which often
necessitated brief trips to the city, Mrs. Rossmore, seconded with
sulky indifference by Eudoxia, was kept busy getting a room ready
for her daughter's arrival.</p>

<p>Eudoxia, who came originally from County Cork, was an Irish
lady with a thick brogue and a husky temper. She was amiable
enough so long as things went to her satisfaction, but when they
did not suit her she was a termagant. She was neither beautiful
nor graceful, she was not young nor was she very clean. Her usual
condition was dishevelled, her face was all askew, and when she
dressed up she looked like
<a class="pagebreak" name="page139" id="page139" title="139"></a>
a valentine. Her greatest weakness was a propensity for smashing
dishes, and when reprimanded she would threaten to take her traps
and skidoo. This news of the arrival of a daughter failed to fill
her with enthusiasm. Firstly, it meant more work; secondly she
had not bargained for it. When she took the place it was on the
understanding that the family consisted only of an elderly
gentleman and his wife, that there was practically no work, good
wages, plenty to eat, with the privilege of an evening out when
she pleased. Instead of this millennium she soon found Stott
installed as a permanent guest and now a daughter was to be
foisted on her. No wonder hard working girls were getting sick and
tired of housework!</p>

<p>As already hinted there was no unhealthy curiosity among
Massapequans regarding their new neighbors from the city but some
of the more prominent people of the place considered it their duty
to seek at least a bowing acquaintance with the Rossmores by
paying them a formal visit. So the day following the conversation
on the porch when the judge and Stott had gone to the city on one
of their periodical excursions, Mrs. Rossmore was startled to see
a gentleman of clerical appearance accompanied by a tall, angular
woman enter their gate and ring the bell.</p>

<p>The Rev. Percival Pontifex Deetle and his sister
<a class="pagebreak" name="page140" id="page140" title="140"></a>
Miss Jane Deetle prided themselves on being leaders in the best
social circle in Massapequa. The incumbent of the local
Presbyterian church, the Rev. Deetle, was a thin, sallow man of
about thirty-five. He had a diminutive face with a rather long and
very pointed nose which gave a comical effect to his physiognomy.
Theology was written all over his person and he wore the
conventional clerical hat which, owing to his absurdly small face,
had the unfortunate appearance of being several sizes too large
for him. Miss Deetle was a gaunt and angular spinster who had an
unhappy trick of talking with a jerk. She looked as if she were
constantly under self-restraint and was liable at any moment to
explode into a fit of rage and only repressed herself with
considerable effort. As they came up the stoop, Eudoxia, already
instructed by Mrs. Rossmore, was ready for them. With her
instinctive respect for the priestly garb she was rather taken
back on seeing a clergyman, but she brazened it out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rossmore's not home.&rdquo; Then shaking her head,
she added: &ldquo;They don't see no visitors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unabashed, the Rev. Deetle drew a card from a case and handing
it to the girl said pompously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will see Mrs. Rossmore. I saw her at the window
as we came along. Here, my girl, take her this card. Tell her that
the Reverend Pontifex
<a class="pagebreak" name="page141" id="page141" title="141"></a>
Deetle and Miss Deetle have called to present their
compliments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brushing past Eudoxia, who vainly tried to close the door, the
Rev. Deetle coolly entered the house, followed by his sister, and
took a seat in the parlour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She'll blame me for this,&rdquo; wailed the girl, who
had not budged and who stood there fingering the Rev. Deetle's
card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blame you? For what?&rdquo; demanded the clerical
visitor in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She told me to say she was out&mdash;but I can't lie to
a minister of the Gospel&mdash;leastways not to his face. I'll
give her your card, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reverend caller waited until Eudoxia had disappeared, then
he rose and looked around curiously at the books and pictures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum&mdash;not a Bible or a prayer book or a hymn book,
not a picture or anything that would indicate the slightest
reverence for holy things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He picked up a few papers that were lying on the table and
after glancing at them threw them down in disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Law reports&mdash;Wall Street reports&mdash;the god of
this world. Evidently very ordinary people, Jane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at his sister, but she sat stiffly and primly in her
chair and made no reply. He repeated:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page142" id="page142" title="142"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Didn't you hear me? I said they are ordinary
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've no doubt,&rdquo; retorted Miss Deetle, &ldquo;and
as such they will not thank us for prying into their
affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prying, did you say?&rdquo; said the parson, resenting
this implied criticism of his actions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just plain prying,&rdquo; persisted his sister angrily.
&ldquo;I don't see what else it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rev. Pontifex straightened up and threw out his chest as he
replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is protecting my flock. As Leader of the Unified All
Souls Baptismal Presbytery, it is my duty to visit the widows and
orphans of this community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people are neither widows or orphans,&rdquo;
objected Miss Deetle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are strangers,&rdquo; insisted the Rev. Pontifex,
&ldquo;and it is my duty to minister to them&mdash;if they need
it. Furthermore it is my duty to my congregation to find out who
is in their midst. No less than three of the Lady Trustees of my
church have asked me who and what these people are and whence they
came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lady Trustees are a pack of old busybodies,&rdquo;
growled his sister.</p>

<p>Her brother raised his finger warningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane, do you know you are uttering a blasphemy? These
Rossmore people have been here two weeks.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page143" id="page143" title="143"></a>
They have visited no one, no one visits them. They have avoided a
temple of worship, they have acted most mysteriously. Who are
they? What are they hiding? Is it fair to my church, is it fair to
my flock? It is not a bereavement, for they don't wear mourning.
I'm afraid it may be some hidden scandal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Further speculations on his part were interrupted by the
entrance of Mrs. Rossmore, who thought rightly that the quickest
way to get rid of her unwelcome visitors was to hurry downstairs
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Deetle&mdash;Mr. Deetle. I am much honoured,&rdquo;
was her not too effusive greeting.</p>

<p>The Reverend Pontifex, anxious to make a favourable impression,
was all smiles and bows. The idea of a possible scandal had for
the moment ceased to worry him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The honour is ours,&rdquo; he stammered.
&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;we&mdash;er&mdash;my sister Jane and I
called to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo; said Mrs. Rossmore, waving
him to a chair. He danced around her in a manner that made her
nervous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; he said with a smile that was
meant to be amiable. He took a seat at the further end of the room
and an awkward pause followed. Finally his sister prompted
him:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page144" id="page144" title="144"></a>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted to see Mrs. Rossmore about the
festival,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, I had quite forgotten. How stupid of me.
The fact is, Mrs. Rossmore,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we are
thinking of giving a festival next week&mdash;a festival with
strawberries&mdash;and our trustees thought, in fact it occurred
to me also that if you and Mr. Rossmore would grace the occasion
with your presence it would give us an opportunity&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;get better acquainted, and er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another awkward pause followed during which he sought
inspiration by gazing fixedly in the fireplace. Then turning on
Mrs. Rossmore so suddenly that the poor woman nearly jumped out of
her chair he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like strawberries?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's very kind of you,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Rossmore,
glad of the opportunity to get a word in edgeways. &ldquo;Indeed,
I appreciate your kindness most keenly but my husband and I go
nowhere, nowhere at all. You see we have met with reverses
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reverses,&rdquo; echoed the clerical visitor, with
difficulty keeping his seat. This was the very thing he had come
to find out and here it was actually thrown at him. He
congratulated himself on his cleverness in having inspired so much
confidence and thought with glee of his triumph when he returned
with the full
<a class="pagebreak" name="page145" id="page145" title="145"></a>
story to the Lady Trustees. Simulating, therefore, the deepest
sympathy he tried to draw his hostess out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, how sad! You met with reverses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning to his sister, who was sitting in her corner like a
petrified mummy, he added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane, do you hear? How inexpressibly sad! They have met
with reverses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, hoping that Mrs. Rossmore would go on to explain
just what their reverses had been, but she was silent. As a gentle
hint he said softly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I interrupt you, Madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, I did not speak,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>Thus baffled, he turned the whites of his eyes up to the
ceiling and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When reverses come we naturally look for spiritual
consolation. My dear Mrs. Rossmore, in the name of the Unified All
Souls Baptismal Presbytery I offer you that
consolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rossmore looked helplessly from one to the other
embarrassed as to what to say. Who were these strangers that
intruded on her privacy offering a consolation she did not want?
Miss Deetle, as if glad of the opportunity to joke at her
brother's expense, said explosively:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Pontifex, you have already offered a
<a class="pagebreak" name="page146" id="page146" title="146"></a>
strawberry festival which Mrs. Rossmore has been unable to
accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Deetle, glaring at
his sister for the irrelevant interruption.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are both most kind,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Rossmore;
&ldquo;but we could not accept in any case. My daughter is
returning home from Paris next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, your daughter&mdash;you have a daughter?&rdquo;
exclaimed Mr. Deetle, grasping at the slightest straw to add to
his stock of information. &ldquo;Coming from Paris, too! Such a
wicked city!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had never been to Paris, he went on to explain, but he had
read enough about it and he was grateful that the Lord had chosen
Massapequa as the field of his labours. Here at least, life was
sweet and wholesome and one's hopes of future salvation fairly
reasonable. He was not a brilliant talker when the conversation
extended beyond Massapequa but he rambled on airing his views on
the viciousness of the foreigner in general, until Mrs. Rossmore,
utterly wearied, began to wonder when they would go. Finally he
fell back upon the weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are very fortunate in having such pleasant weather,
don't you think so, Madam? Oh, Massapequa is a lovely spot, isn't
it? We think it's the one place
<a class="pagebreak" name="page147" id="page147" title="147"></a>
to live in. We are all one happy family. That's why my sister and
I called to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very good, I'm sure. I shall tell my husband you
came and he'll be very pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having exhausted his conversational powers and seeing that
further efforts to pump Mrs. Rossmore were useless, the clerical
visitor rose to depart:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like rain. Come, Jane, we had better go.
Good-bye, Madam, I am delighted to have made this little visit and
I trust you will assure Mr. Rossmore that All Souls Unified
Baptismal Presbytery always has a warm welcome for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They bowed and Mrs. Rossmore bowed. The agony was over and as
the door closed on them Mrs. Rossmore gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>That evening Stott and the judge came home earlier than usual
and from their dejected appearance Mrs. Rossmore divined bad
news. The judge was painfully silent throughout the meal and Stott
was unusually grave. Finally the latter took her aside and broke
it to her gently. In spite of their efforts and the efforts of
their friends the Congressional inquiry had resulted in a finding
against the judge and a demand had already been made upon the
Senate for his impeachment. They could do nothing now but fight
it in the Senate with all the influence they could muster. It was
going
<a class="pagebreak" name="page148" id="page148" title="148"></a>
to be hard but Stott was confident that right would prevail. After
dinner as they were sitting in silence on the porch, each
measuring the force of this blow which they had expected yet had
always hoped to ward off, the crunching sound of a bicycle was
heard on the quiet country road. The rider stopped at their gate
and came up the porch holding out an envelope to the judge, who,
guessing the contents, had started forward. He tore it open. It
was a cablegram from Paris and read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>Am sailing on the Kaiser Wilhelm to-day.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote class="signature"><i>Shirley.</i></blockquote>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page149" id="page149" title="149"></a>
<a name="chapter7" id="chapter7"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>The pier of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company, at
Hoboken, fairly sizzled with bustle and excitement. The Kaiser
Wilhelm had arrived at Sandy Hook the previous evening and was now
lying out in midstream. She would tie up at her dock within half
an hour. Employés of the line, baggage masters, newspaper
reporters, Custom House officers, policemen, detectives, truck
drivers, expressmen, longshoremen, telegraph messengers and
anxious friends of incoming passengers surged back and forth in
seemingly hopeless confusion. The shouting of orders, the rattling
of cab wheels, the shrieking of whistles was deafening. From out
in the river came the deep toned blasts of the steamer's siren, in
grotesque contrast with the strident tooting of a dozen diminutive
tugs which, puffing and snorting, were slowly but surely coaxing
the leviathan into her berth alongside the dock. The great vessel,
spick and span after a coat of fresh paint hurriedly put on during
the last day of the voyage, bore no traces of gale, fog and stormy
seas through which she had passed on her
<a class="pagebreak" name="page150" id="page150" title="150"></a>
3,000 mile run across the ocean. Conspicuous on the bridge,
directing the docking operations, stood Capt. Hegermann, self
satisfied and smiling, relieved that the responsibilities of
another trip were over, and at his side, sharing the honours, was
the grizzled pilot who had brought the ship safely through the
dangers of Gedney's Channel, his shabby pea jacket, old slouch
hat, top boots and unkempt beard standing out in sharp contrast
with the immaculate white duck trousers, the white and gold caps
and smart full dress uniforms of the ship's officers. The rails on
the upper decks were seen to be lined with passengers, all dressed
in their shore going clothes, some waving handkerchiefs at friends
they already recognized, all impatiently awaiting the shipping of
the gangplank.</p>

<p>Stott had come early. They had received word at Massapequa the
day before that the steamer had been sighted off Fire Island and
that she would be at her pier the next morning at 10 o'clock.
Stott arrived at 9.30 and so found no difficulty in securing a
front position among the small army of people, who, like himself,
had come down to meet friends.</p>

<p>As the huge vessel swung round and drew closer, Stott easily
picked out Shirley. She was scanning eagerly through a binocular
the rows of upturned faces on the dock, and he noted that a look
of disappointment
<a class="pagebreak" name="page151" id="page151" title="151"></a>
crossed her face at not finding the object of her search. She
turned and said something to a lady in black and to a man who
stood at her side. Who they might be Stott had no idea. Fellow
passengers, no doubt. One becomes so intimate on shipboard; it
seems a friendship that must surely last a lifetime,
whereas&mdash;the custom officers have not finished rummaging
through your trunks when these easily-made steamer friends are
already forgotten. Presently Shirley took another look and her
glass soon lighted on him. Instantly she recognized her father's
old friend. She waved a handkerchief and Stott raised his hat.
Then she turned quickly and spoke again to her friends, whereupon
they all moved in the direction of the gangplank, which was
already being lowered.</p>

<p>Shirley was one of the first to come ashore. Stott was waiting
for her at the foot of the gangplank and she threw her arms round
his neck and kissed him. He had known her ever since she was a
little tot in arms, and bystanders who noticed them meet had no
doubt that they were father and daughter. Shirley was deeply
moved; a great lump in her throat seemed to choke her utterance.
So far she had been able to bear up, but now that home was so near
her heart failed her. She had hoped to find her father on the
dock. Why had he not come? Were things so bad
<a class="pagebreak" name="page152" id="page152" title="152"></a>
then? She questioned Judge Stott anxiously, fearfully.</p>

<p>He reassured her. Both her mother and father were well. It was
too long a trip for them to make, so he had volunteered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too long a trip,&rdquo; echoed Shirley puzzled.
&ldquo;This is not far from our house. Madison Avenue is no
distance. That could not have kept father away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't live on Madison Avenue any longer. The house
and its contents have been sold,&rdquo; replied Stott gravely, and
in a few words he outlined the situation as it was.</p>

<p>Shirley listened quietly to the end and only the increasing
pallor of her face and an occasional nervous twitching at the
corner of her mouth betrayed the shock that this recital of her
father's misfortunes was to her. Ah, this she had little dreamed
of! Yet why not? It was but logic. When wrecked in reputation, one
might as well be wrecked in fortune, too. What would their future
be, how could that proud, sensitive man her father bear this
humiliation, this disgrace? To be condemned to a life of
obscurity, social ostracism, and genteel poverty! Oh, the thought
was unendurable! She herself could earn money, of course. If her
literary work did not bring in enough, she could teach and what
she earned would help out. Certainly her parents should never
want for anything
<a class="pagebreak" name="page153" id="page153" title="153"></a>
so long as she could supply it. She thought bitterly how futile
now were plans of marriage, even if she had ever entertained such
an idea seriously. Henceforward, she did not belong to herself.
Her life must be devoted to clearing her father's name. These
reflections were suddenly interrupted by the voice of Mrs. Blake
calling out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shirley, where have you been? We lost sight of you as we
left the ship, and we have been hunting for you ever
since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her aunt, escorted by Jefferson Ryder, had gone direct to the
Customs desk and in the crush they had lost trace of her. Shirley
introduced Stott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Milly, this is Judge Stott, a very old friend of
father's. Mrs. Blake, my mother's sister. Mother will be surprised
to see her. They haven't met for ten years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This visit is going to be only a brief one,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Blake. &ldquo;I really came over to chaperone Shirley more
than anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if I needed chaperoning with Mr. Ryder for an
escort!&rdquo; retorted Shirley. Then presenting Jefferson to
Stott she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Jefferson Ryder&mdash;Judge Stott. Mr.
Ryder has been very kind to me abroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men bowed and shook hands.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page154" id="page154" title="154"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Any relation to J.B.?&rdquo; asked Stott good
humouredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His son&mdash;that's all,&rdquo; answered Jefferson
laconically.</p>

<p>Stott now looked at the young man with more interest. Yes,
there was a resemblance, the same blue eyes, the righting jaw. But
how on earth did Judge Rossmore's daughter come to be travelling
in the company of John Burkett Ryder's son? The more he thought of
it the more it puzzled him, and while he cogitated Shirley and her
companions wrestled with the United States Customs, and were
undergoing all the tortures invented by Uncle Sam to punish
Americans for going abroad.</p>

<p>Shirley and Mrs. Blake were fortunate in securing an inspector
who was fairly reasonable. Of course, he did not for a moment
believe their solemn statement, already made on the ship, that
they had nothing dutiable, and he rummaged among the most intimate
garments of their wardrobe in a wholly indecent and unjustifiable
manner, but he was polite and they fared no worse than all the
other women victims of this, the most brutal custom house
inspection system in the world.</p>

<p>Jefferson had the misfortune to be allotted an inspector who
was half seas over with liquor and the man
<a class="pagebreak" name="page155" id="page155" title="155"></a>
was so insolent and threatening in manner that it was only by
great self-restraint that Jefferson controlled himself. He had no
wish to create a scandal on the dock, nor to furnish good
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; for the keen-eyed, long-eared newspaper
reporters who would be only too glad of such an opportunity for a
&ldquo;scare head,&rdquo; But when the fellow compelled him to
open every trunk and valise and then put his grimy hands to the
bottom and by a quick upward movement jerked the entire contents
out on the dock he interfered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are exceeding your authority,&rdquo; he exclaimed
hotly. &ldquo;How dare you treat my things in this
manner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The drunken uniformed brute raised his bloodshot, bleary eyes
and took Jefferson in from tip to toe. He clenched his fist as if
about to resort to violence, but he was not so intoxicated as to
be quite blind to the fact that this passenger had massive square
shoulders, a determined jaw and probably a heavy arm. So
contenting himself with a sneer, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This ain't no country for blooming English dooks.
You're not in England now you know. This is a free country.
See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see this,&rdquo; replied Jefferson, furious
&ldquo;that you
<a class="pagebreak" name="page156" id="page156" title="156"></a>
are a drunken ruffian and a disgrace to the uniform you wear. I
shall report your conduct immediately,&rdquo; with which he
proceeded to the Customs desk to lodge a complaint.</p>

<p>He might have spared himself the trouble. The silver haired,
distinguished looking old officer in charge knew that Jefferson's
complaint was well founded, he knew that this particular inspector
was a drunkard and a discredit to the government which employed
him, but at the same time he also knew that political influence
had been behind his appointment and that it was unsafe to do more
than mildly reprimand him. When, therefore, he accompanied
Jefferson to the spot where the contents of the trunks lay
scattered in confusion all over the dock, he merely expostulated
with the officer, who made some insolent reply. Seeing that it was
useless to lose further time, Jefferson repacked his trunks as
best he could and got them on a cab. Then he hurried over to
Shirley's party and found them already about to leave the
pier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and see us, Jeff,&rdquo; whispered Shirley as their
cab drove through the gates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;Madison
Avenue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment and then replied quickly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we are stopping down on Long Island for the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page157" id="page157" title="157"></a>
Summer&mdash;at a cute little place called Massapequa. Run down
and see us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his hat and the cab drove on.</p>

<br />

<p>There was greater activity in the Rossmore cottage at
Massapequa than there had been any day since the judge and his
wife went to live there. Since daybreak Eudoxia had been scouring
and polishing in honour of the expected arrival and a hundred
times Mrs. Rossmore had climbed the stairs to see that everything
was as it should be in the room which had been prepared for
Shirley. It was not, however, without a passage at arms that
Eudoxia consented to consider the idea of an addition to the
family. Mrs. Rossmore had said to her the day before:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter will be here to-morrow, Eudoxia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A look expressive of both displeasure and astonishment marred
the classic features of the hireling. Putting her broom aside and
placing her arms akimbo she exclaimed in an injured tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it's a dayther you've got now? So it's three in
family you are! When I took the place it's two you tould me there
was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, with your kind permission,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page158" id="page158" title="158"></a>
Rossmore, &ldquo;there will be three in future. There is nothing
in the Constitution of the United States that says we can't have a
daughter without consulting our help, is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sarcasm of this reply did not escape even the dull-edged
wits of the Irish drudge. She relapsed into a dignified silence
and a few minutes later was discovered working with some show of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The judge was nervous and fidgety. He made a pretence to read,
but it was plain to see that his mind was not on his book. He kept
leaving his chair to go and look at the clock; then he would lay
the volume aside and wander from room to room like a lost soul.
His thoughts were on the dock at Hoboken.</p>

<p>By noon every little detail had been attended to and there was
nothing further to do but sit and wait for the arrival of Stott
and Shirley. They were to be expected any moment now. The
passengers had probably got off the steamer by eleven o'clock. It
would take at least two hours to get through the Customs and out
to Massapequa. The judge and his wife sat on the porch counting
the minutes and straining their ears to catch the first sound of
the train from New York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Stott broke the news to her gently,&rdquo; said
the judge.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page159" id="page159" title="159"></a>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had gone to meet her ourselves,&rdquo; sighed
his wife.</p>

<p>The judge was silent and for a moment or two he puffed
vigorously at his pipe, as was his habit when disturbed mentally.
Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to have gone, Martha, but I was afraid. I'm
afraid to look my own daughter in the face and tell her that I am
a disgraced man, that I am to be tried by the Senate for
corruption, perhaps impeached and turned off the bench as if I
were a criminal. Shirley won't believe it, sometimes I can't
believe it myself. I often wake up in the night and think of it
as part of a dream, but when the morning comes it's still
true&mdash;it's still true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smoked on in silence. Then happening to look up he noticed
that his wife was weeping. He laid his hand gently on hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't cry, dear, don't make it harder for me to bear.
Shirley must see no trace of tears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of the injustice of it all,&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Rossmore, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fancy Shirley in this place, living from hand to
mouth,&rdquo; went on the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's the least,&rdquo; answered his wife. &ldquo;She's
a fine, handsome girl, well educated and all the rest of it. She
ought to make a good marriage.&rdquo; No matter what
<a class="pagebreak" name="page160" id="page160" title="160"></a>
state of mind Mrs. Rossmore might be in, she never lost sight of
the practical side of things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly with her father's disgrace hanging over her
head,&rdquo; replied the judge wearily. &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;would have the courage to marry a girl whose father
was publicly disgraced?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both relapsed into another long silence, each mentally
reviewing the past and speculating on the future. Suddenly Mrs.
Rossmore started. Surely she could not be mistaken! No, the
clanging of a locomotive bell was plainly audible. The train was
in. From the direction of the station came people with parcels and
hand bags and presently there was heard the welcome sound of
carriage wheels crunching over the stones. A moment later they
saw coming round the bend in the road a cab piled up with small
baggage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are! Here they are!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Rossmore. &ldquo;Come, Eudoxia!&rdquo; she called to the servant,
while she herself hurried down to the gate. The judge, fully as
agitated as herself, only showing his emotion in a different way,
remained on the porch pale and anxious.</p>

<p>The cab stopped at the curb and Stott alighted, first helping
out Mrs. Blake. Mrs. Rossmore's astonishment on seeing her sister
was almost comical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milly!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page161" id="page161" title="161"></a>
<p>They embraced first and explained afterwards. Then Shirley got
out and was in her mother's arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's father?&rdquo; was Shirley's first question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;he's coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge, unable to restrain his impatience longer, ran down
from the porch towards the gate. Shirley, with a cry of mingled
grief and joy, precipitated herself on his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father! Father!&rdquo; she cried between her sobs.
&ldquo;What have they done to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there, my child. Everything will be
well&mdash;everything will be well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her head lay on his shoulder and he stroked her hair with his
hand, unable to speak from pent up emotion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rossmore could not recover from her stupefaction on seeing
her sister. Mrs. Blake explained that she had come chiefly for the
benefit of the voyage and announced her intention of returning on
the same steamer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you see I shall bother you only a few days,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll stay just as long as you wish,&rdquo; rejoined
Mrs. Rossmore. &ldquo;Happily we have just one bedroom
left.&rdquo; Then turning to Eudoxia, who was wrestling
<a class="pagebreak" name="page162" id="page162" title="162"></a>
with the baggage, which formed a miniature Matterhorn on the
sidewalk, she gave instructions:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eudoxia, you'll take this lady's baggage to the small
bedroom adjoining Miss Shirley's. She is going to stop with us for
a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taken completely aback at the news of this new addition,
Eudoxia looked at first defiance. She seemed on the point of
handing in her resignation there and then. But evidently she
thought better of it, for, taking a cue from Mrs. Rossmore, she
asked in the sarcastic manner of her mistress:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four is it now, M'm? I suppose the Constitootion of the
United States allows a family to be as big as one likes to make
it. It's hard on us girls, but if it's the law, it's all right,
M'm. The more the merrier!&rdquo; With which broadside, she hung
the bags all over herself and staggered off to the house.</p>

<p>Stott explained that the larger pieces and the trunks would
come later by express. Mrs. Rossmore took him aside while Mrs.
Blake joined Shirley and the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell Shirley?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Rossmore.
&ldquo;How did she take it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knows everything,&rdquo; answered Stott, &ldquo;and
takes it very sensibly. We shall find her of great
<a class="pagebreak" name="page163" id="page163" title="163"></a>
moral assistance in our coming fight in the Senate,&rdquo; he
added confidently.</p>

<blockquote class="illustration"><a href="images/illus2.jpg">

<blockquote class="central">&ldquo;Father! Father! What have they done to
you?&rdquo;&mdash;<a href="#page161"><i>Page 161.</i></a></blockquote>

<p>Realizing that the judge would like to be left alone with
Shirley, Mrs. Rossmore invited Mrs. Blake to go upstairs and see
the room she would have, while Stott said he would be glad of a
washup. When they had gone Shirley sidled up to her father in her
old familiar way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've just been longing to see you, father,&rdquo; she
said. She turned to get a good look at him and noticing the lines
of care which had deepened during her absence she cried:
&ldquo;Why, how you've changed! I can scarcely believe it's you.
Say something. Let me hear the sound of your voice,
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge tried to smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear girl, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley threw her arms round his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, now I know it's you,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is, Shirley, my dear girl. Of course it is.
Who else should it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it isn't the same,&rdquo; insisted Shirley.
&ldquo;There is no ring to your voice. It sounds hollow and empty,
like an echo. And this place,&rdquo; she added dolefully,
&ldquo;this awful place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced around at the cracked ceilings, the cheaply papered
walls, the shabby furniture, and her
<a class="pagebreak" name="page164" id="page164" title="164"></a>
heart sank as she realized the extent of their misfortune. She
had come back prepared for the worst, to help win the fight for
her father's honour, but to have to struggle against sordid
poverty as well, to endure that humiliation in addition to
disgrace&mdash;ah, that was something she had not anticipated! She
changed colour and her voice faltered. Her father had been closely
watching for just such signs and he read her thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's the best we can afford, Shirley,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;The blow has been complete. I will tell you
everything. You shall judge for yourself. My enemies have done for
me at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your enemies?&rdquo; cried Shirley eagerly. &ldquo;Tell
me who they are so I may go to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, you shall know everything. But not now. You
are tired after your journey. To-morrow sometime Stott and I will
explain everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, father, as you wish,&rdquo; said Shirley
gently. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she added in an effort to appear
cheerful, &ldquo;what matter where we live so long as we have each
other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew away to hide her tears and left the room on pretence
of inspecting the house. She looked into the dining-room and
kitchen and opened the cupboards, and when she returned there were
no visible signs of trouble in her face.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page165" id="page165" title="165"></a>
<p>&ldquo;It's a cute little house, isn't it?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I've always wanted a little place like this&mdash;all to
ourselves. Oh, if you only knew how tired I am of New York and
its great ugly houses, its retinue of servants and its domestic
and social responsibilities! We shall be able to live for
ourselves now, eh, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke with a forced gaiety that might have deceived anyone
but the judge. He understood the motive of her sudden change in
manner and silently he blessed her for making his burden
lighter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, it's not bad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There's
not much room, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's quite enough,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Let me
see.&rdquo; She began to count on her fingers.
&ldquo;Upstairs&mdash;three rooms, eh? and above that three
more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; smiled the judge, &ldquo;then comes the
roof?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;how stupid of
me&mdash;a nice gable roof, a sloping roof that the rain runs off
beautifully. Oh, I can see that this is going to be awfully
jolly&mdash;just like camping out. You know how I love camping
out. And you have a piano, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went over to the corner where stood one of those homely
instruments which hardly deserve to be dignified by the name
piano, with a cheap, gaudily painted case outside and a tin pan
effect inside, and which are usually to be found in the poorer
class of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page166" id="page166" title="166"></a>
country boarding houses. Shirley sat down and ran her fingers over
the keys, determined to like everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a little old,&rdquo; was her comment, &ldquo;but I
like these zither effects. It's just like the sixteenth century
spinet. I can see you and mother dancing a stately minuet,&rdquo;
she smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's that about mother dancing?&rdquo; demanded Mrs.
Rossmore, who at that instant entered the room. Shirley arose and
appealed to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't it absurd, mother, when you come to think of it,
that anybody should accuse father of being corrupt and of having
forfeited the right to be judge? Isn't it still more absurd that
we should be helpless and dejected and unhappy because we are on
Long Island instead of Madison Avenue? Why should Manhattan Island
be a happier spot than Long Island? Why shouldn't we be happy
anywhere; we have each other. And we do need each other. We never
knew how much till to-day, did we? We must stand by each other
now. Father is going to clear his name of this preposterous charge
and we're going to help him, aren't we, mother? We're not helpless
just because we are women. We're going to work, mother and
I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work?&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Rossmore, somewhat
scandalized.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page167" id="page167" title="167"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Work,&rdquo; repeated Shirley very decisively.</p>

<p>The judge interfered. He would not hear of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You work, Shirley? Impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? My book has been selling well while I was
abroad. I shall probably write others. Then I shall write, too,
for the newspapers and magazines. It will add to our
income.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your book&mdash;&lsquo;The American Octopus,&rsquo; is
selling well?&rdquo; inquired the judge, interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So well,&rdquo; replied Shirley, &ldquo;that the
publishers wrote me in Paris that the fourth edition was now on
the press. That means good royalties. I shall soon be a
fashionable author. The publishers will be after me for more books
and we'll have all the money we want. Oh, it is so delightful,
this novel sensation of a literary success!&rdquo; she exclaimed
with glee. &ldquo;Aren't you proud of me, dad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge smiled indulgently. Of course he was glad and proud.
He always knew his Shirley was a clever girl. But by what strange
fatality, he thought to himself, had his daughter in this book of
hers assailed the very man who had encompassed his own ruin? It
seemed like the retribution of heaven. Neither his daughter nor
the financier was conscious of the fact that each was indirectly
connected with the impeachment proceedings. Ryder could not dream
that
<a class="pagebreak" name="page168" id="page168" title="168"></a>
&ldquo;Shirley Green,&rdquo; the author of the book which flayed
him so mercilessly, was the daughter of the man he was trying to
crush. Shirley, on the other hand, was still unaware of the fact
that it was Ryder who had lured her father to his ruin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rossmore now insisted on Shirley going to her room to
rest. She must be tired and dusty. After changing her travelling
dress she would feel refreshed and more comfortable. When she was
ready to come down again luncheon would be served. So leaving the
judge to his papers, mother and daughter went upstairs together,
and with due maternal pride Mrs. Rossmore pointed out to Shirley
all the little arrangements she had made for her comfort. Then she
left her daughter to herself while she hurried downstairs to look
after Eudoxia and luncheon.</p>

<p>When, at last, she could lock herself in her room where no eye
could see her, Shirley threw herself down on the bed and burst
into a torrent of tears. She had kept up appearances as long as it
was possible, but now the reaction had set in. She gave way freely
to her pent up feelings, she felt that unless she could relieve
herself in this way her heart would break. She had been brave
until now, she had been strong to hear everything and see
everything, but she could not keep it up forever. Stott's words to
her on the dock had in
<a class="pagebreak" name="page169" id="page169" title="169"></a>
part prepared her for the worst, he had told her what to expect at
home, but the realization was so much more vivid. While hundreds
of miles of ocean still lay between, it had all seemed less real,
almost attractive as a romance in modern life, but now she was
face to face with the grim reality&mdash;this shabby cottage,
cheap neighbourhood and commonplace surroundings, her mother's air
of resignation to the inevitable, her father's pale, drawn face
telling so eloquently of the keen mental anguish through which he
had passed. She compared this pitiful spectacle with what they
had been when she left for Europe, the fine mansion on Madison
Avenue with its rich furnishings and well-trained servants, and
her father's proud aristocratic face illumined with the
consciousness of his high rank in the community, and the attention
he attracted every time he appeared on the street or in public
places as one of the most brilliant and most respected judges on
the bench. Then to have come to this all in the brief space of a
few months! It was incredible, terrible, heart rending! And what
of the future? What was to be done to save her father from this
impeachment which she knew well would hurry him to his grave? He
could not survive that humiliation, that degradation. He must be
saved in the Senate, but how&mdash;how?</p>

<p>She dried her eyes and began to think. Surely her
<a class="pagebreak" name="page170" id="page170" title="170"></a>
woman's wit would find some way. She thought of Jefferson. Would
he come to Massapequa? It was hardly probable. He would certainly
learn of the change in their circumstances and his sense of
delicacy would naturally keep him away for some time even if other
considerations, less unselfish, did not. Perhaps he would be
attracted to some other girl he would like as well and who was not
burdened with a tragedy in her family. Her tears began to flow
afresh until she hated herself for being so weak while there was
work to be done to save her father. She loved Jefferson. Yes, she
had never felt so sure of it as now. She felt that if she had him
there at that moment she would throw herself in his arms crying:
&ldquo;Take me, Jefferson, take me away, where you will, for I
love you! I love you!&rdquo; But Jefferson was not there and the
rickety chairs in the tiny bedroom and the cheap prints on the
walls seemed to jibe at her in her misery. If he were there, she
thought as she looked into a cracked mirror, he would think her
very ugly with her eyes all red from crying. He would not marry
her now in any case. No self-respecting man would. She was glad
that she had spoken to him as she had in regard to marriage, for
while a stain remained upon her father's name marriage was out of
the question. She might have yielded on the question of the
literary career, but
<a class="pagebreak" name="page171" id="page171" title="171"></a>
she would never allow a man to taunt her afterwards with the
disgrace of her own flesh and blood. No, henceforth her place was
at her father's side until his character was cleared. If the trial
in the Senate were to go against him, then she could never see
Jefferson again. She would give up all idea of him and everything
else. Her literary career would be ended, her life would be a
blank. They would have to go abroad, where they were not known,
and try and live down their shame, for no matter how innocent her
father might be the world would believe him guilty. Once condemned
by the Senate, nothing could remove the stigma. She would have to
teach in order to contribute towards the support, they would
manage somehow. But what a future, how unnecessary, how
unjust!</p>

<p>Suddenly she thought of Jefferson's promise to interest his
father in their case and she clutched at the hope this promise
held out as a drowning man clutches at a drifting straw. Jefferson
would not forget his promise and he would come to Massapequa to
tell her of what he had done. She was sure of that. Perhaps, after
all, there was where their hope lay. Why had she not told her
father at once? It might have relieved his mind. John Burkett
Ryder, the Colossus, the man of unlimited power! He could save her
father and he would. And the more she thought about it, the more
<a class="pagebreak" name="page172" id="page172" title="172"></a>
cheerful and more hopeful she became, and she started to dress
quickly so that she might hurry down to tell her father the good
news. She was actually sorry now that she had said so many hard
things of Mr. Ryder in her book and she was worrying over the
thought that her father's case might be seriously prejudiced if
the identity of the author were ever revealed, when there came a
knock at her door. It was Eudoxia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, miss, will you come down to lunch?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>A whirling maelstrom of human activity and dynamic
energy&mdash;the city which above all others is characteristic of
the genius and virility of the American people&mdash;New York,
with its congested polyglot population and teeming millions, is
assuredly one of the busiest, as it is one of the most strenuous
and most noisy places on earth. Yet, despite its swarming streets
and crowded shops, ceaselessly thronged with men and women eagerly
hurrying here and there in the pursuit of business or elusive
pleasure, all chattering, laughing, shouting amid the deafening,
multisonous roar of traffic incidental to Gotham's daily life,
there is one part of the great metropolis where there is no
bustle, no noise, no crowd, where the streets are empty even in
daytime, where a passer-by is a curiosity and a child a
phenomenon. This deserted village in the very heart of the big
town is the millionaires' district, the boundaries of which are
marked by Carnegie hill on the north, Fiftieth Street on the
south, and by Fifth and Madison Avenues respectively on the west
and east. There is nothing more mournful than
<a class="pagebreak" name="page174" id="page174" title="174"></a>
the outward aspect of these princely residences which, abandoned
and empty for three-quarters of the year, stand in stately
loneliness, as if ashamed of their isolation and utter
uselessness. Their blinds drawn, affording no hint of life within,
enveloped the greater part of the time in the stillness and
silence of the tomb, they appear to be under the spell of some
baneful curse. No merry-voiced children romp in their carefully
railed off gardens, no sounds of conversation or laughter come
from their hermetically closed windows, not a soul goes in or out,
at most, at rare intervals, does one catch a glimpse of a
gorgeously arrayed servant gliding about in ghostly fashion,
supercilious and suspicious, and addressing the chance visitor in
awed whispers as though he were the guardian of a house of
affliction. It is, indeed, like a city of the dead.</p>

<p>So it appeared to Jefferson as he walked up Fifth Avenue, bound
for the Ryder residence, the day following his arrival from
Europe. Although he still lived at his father's house, for at no
time had there been an open rupture, he often slept in his studio,
finding it more convenient for his work, and there he had gone
straight from the ship. He felt, however, that it was his duty to
see his mother as soon as possible; besides he was anxious to
fulfil his promise to Shirley and find what his father could do to
help Judge
<a class="pagebreak" name="page175" id="page175" title="175"></a>
Rossmore. He had talked about the case with several men the
previous evening at the club and the general impression seemed to
be that, guilty or innocent, the judge would be driven off the
bench. The &ldquo;interests&rdquo; had forced the matter as a
party issue, and the Republicans being in control in the Senate
the outcome could hardly be in doubt. He had learned also of the
other misfortunes which had befallen Judge Rossmore and he
understood now the reason for Shirley's grave face on the dock and
her little fib about summering on Long Island. The news had been a
shock to him, for, apart from the fact that the judge was
Shirley's father, he admired him immensely as a man. Of his
perfect innocence there could, of course, be no question: these
charges of bribery had simply been trumped up by his enemies to
get him off the bench. That was very evident. The
&ldquo;interests&rdquo; feared him and so had sacrificed him
without pity, and as Jefferson walked along Central Park, past the
rows of superb palaces which face its eastern wall, he wondered in
which particular mansion had been hatched this wicked, iniquitous
plot against a wholly blameless American citizen. Here, he
thought, were the citadels of the plutocrats, America's
aristocracy of money, the strongholds of her Coal, Railroad, Oil,
Gas and Ice barons, the castles of her monarchs of Steel, Copper,
and Finance. Each of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page176" id="page176" title="176"></a>
these million-dollar residences, he pondered, was filled from
cellar to roof with costly furnishings, masterpieces of painting
and sculpture, priceless art treasures of all kinds purchased in
every corner of the globe with the gold filched from a
Trust-ridden people. For every stone in those marble halls a human
being, other than the owner, had been sold into bondage, for each
of these magnificent edifices, which the plutocrat put up in his
pride only to occupy it two months in the year, ten thousand
American men, women and children had starved and sorrowed.</p>

<p>Europe, thought Jefferson as he strode quickly along, pointed
with envy to America's unparalleled prosperity, spoke with bated
breath of her great fortunes. Rather should they say her gigantic
robberies, her colossal frauds! As a nation we were not proud of
our multi-millionaires. How many of them would bear the
searchlight of investigation? Would his own father? How many
millions could one man make by honest methods? America was
enjoying unprecedented prosperity, not because of her
millionaires, but in spite of them. The United States owed its
high rank in the family of nations to the country's vast natural
resources, its inexhaustible vitality, its great wheat fields, the
industrial and mechanical genius of its people. It was the plain
American citizen who had made the greatness
<a class="pagebreak" name="page177" id="page177" title="177"></a>
of America, not the millionaires who, forming a class by
themselves of unscrupulous capitalists, had created an arrogant
oligarchy which sought to rule the country by corrupting the
legislature and the judiciary. The plutocrats&mdash;these were the
leeches, the sores in the body politic. An organized band of
robbers, they had succeeded in dominating legislation and in
securing control of every branch of the nation's industry,
crushing mercilessly and illegally all competition. They were the
Money Power, and such a menace were they to the welfare of the
people that, it had been estimated, twenty men in America had it
in their power, by reason of the vast wealth which they
controlled, to come together, and within twenty-four hours arrive
at an understanding by which every wheel of trade and commerce
would be stopped from revolving, every avenue of trade blocked and
every electric key struck dumb. Those twenty men could paralyze
the whole country, for they controlled the circulation of the
currency and could create a panic whenever they might choose. It
was the rapaciousness and insatiable greed of these plutocrats
that had forced the toilers to combine for self-protection,
resulting in the organization of the Labor Unions which, in time,
became almost as tyrannical and unreasonable as the bosses. And
the breach between capital on the one hand and labour on the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page178" id="page178" title="178"></a>
other was widening daily, masters and servants snarling over wages
and hours, the quarrel ever increasing in bitterness and acrimony
until one day the extreme limit of patience would be reached and
industrial strikes would give place to bloody violence.</p>

<p>Meantime the plutocrats, wholly careless of the significant
signs of the times and the growing irritation and resentment of
the people, continued their illegal practices, scoffing at public
opinion, snapping their fingers at the law, even going so far in
their insolence as to mock and jibe at the President of the United
States. Feeling secure in long immunity and actually protected in
their wrong doing by the courts&mdash;the legal machinery by its
very elaborateness defeating the ends of justice&mdash;the Trust
kings impudently defied the country and tried to impose their own
will upon the people. History had thus repeated itself. The armed
feudalism of the middle ages had been succeeded in twentieth
century America by the tyranny of capital.</p>

<p>Yet, ruminated the young artist as he neared the Ryder
residence, the American people had but themselves to blame for
their present thralldom. Forty years before Abraham Lincoln had
warned the country when at the close of the war he saw that the
race for wealth was already making men and women money-mad. In
1864 he wrote these words:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page179" id="page179" title="179"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we may congratulate ourselves that this cruel war
is nearing its close. It has cost a vast amount of treasure and
blood. The best blood of the flower of American youth has been
freely offered upon our country's altar that the nation might
live. It has been indeed a trying hour for the Republic, but I see
in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and
causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a result of
the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption
in high places will follow and the money power of the country will
endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of
the people until all the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and
the Republic is destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Truly prophetic these solemn words were to-day. Forgetting the
austere simplicity of their forebears, a love of show and
ostentation had become the ruling passion of the American people.
Money, <small>MONEY</small>, MONEY! was to-day the only standard,
the only god! The whole nation, frenzied with a wild lust for
wealth no matter how acquired, had tacitly acquiesced in all sorts
of turpitude, every description of moral depravity, and so had
fallen an easy victim to the band of capitalistic adventurers who
now virtually ruled the land. With the thieves in power, the
courts were powerless, the demoralization was general and the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page180" id="page180" title="180"></a>
world was afforded the edifying spectacle of an entire country
given up to an orgy of graft&mdash;treason in the
Senate&mdash;corruption in the Legislature, fraudulent elections,
leaks in government reports, trickery in Wall Street, illegal
corners in coal, meat, ice and other prime necessaries of life,
the deadly horrors of the Beef and Drug Trusts, railroad
conspiracies, insurance scandals, the wrecking of savings banks,
police dividing spoils with pickpockets and sharing the wages of
prostitutes, magistrates charged with blackmailing&mdash;a foul
stench of social rottenness and decay! What, thought Jefferson,
would be the outcome&mdash;Socialism or Anarchy?</p>

<p>Still, he mused, one ray of hope pierced the general
gloom&mdash;the common sense, the vigour and the intelligence of
the true American man and woman, the love for a &ldquo;square
deal&rdquo; which was characteristic of the plain people, the
resistless force of enlightened public opinion. The country was
merely passing through a dark phase in its history, it was the era
of the grafters. There would come a reaction, the rascals would
be exposed and driven off, and the nation would go on upward
toward its high destiny. The country was fortunate, too, in having
a strong president, a man of high principles and undaunted courage
who had already shown his capacity to deal with the critical
situation.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page181" id="page181" title="181"></a>
America was lucky with her presidents. Picked out by the great
political parties as mere figureheads, sometimes they deceived
their sponsors, and showed themselves men and patriots. Such a
president was Theodore Roosevelt. After beginning vigorous warfare
on the Trusts, attacking fearlessly the most rascally of the band,
the chief of the nation had sounded the slogan of alarm in regard
to the multi-millionaires. The amassing of colossal fortunes, he
had declared, must be stopped&mdash;a man might accumulate more
than sufficient for his own needs and for the needs of his
children, but the evil practice of perpetuating great and
ever-increasing fortunes for generations yet unborn was recognized
as a peril to the State. To have had the courage to propose such a
sweeping and radical restrictive measure as this should alone,
thought Jefferson, ensure for Theodore Roosevelt a place among
America's greatest and wisest statesmen. He and Americans of his
calibre would eventually perform the titanic task of cleansing
these Augean stables, the muck and accumulated filth of which was
sapping the health and vitality of the nation.</p>

<p>Jefferson turned abruptly and went up the wide steps of an
imposing white marble edifice, which took up the space of half a
city block. A fine example of French Renaissance architecture,
with spire roofs,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page182" id="page182" title="182"></a>
round turrets and mullioned windows dominating the neighbouring
houses, this magnificent home of the plutocrat, with its
furnishings and art treasures, had cost John Burkett Ryder nearly
ten millions of dollars. It was one of the show places of the
town, and when the &ldquo;rubber neck&rdquo; wagons approached the
Ryder mansion and the guides, through their megaphones, expatiated
in awe-stricken tones on its external and hidden beauties, there
was a general craning of vertebr&aelig; among the &ldquo;seeing
New York&rdquo;-ers to catch a glimpse of the abode of the richest
man in the world.</p>

<p>Only a few privileged ones were ever permitted to penetrate to
the interior of this ten-million-dollar home. Ryder was not fond
of company, he avoided strangers and lived in continual
apprehension of the subp&oelig;na server. Not that he feared the
law, only he usually found it inconvenient to answer questions in
court under oath. The explicit instructions to the servants,
therefore, were to admit no one under any pretext whatever unless
the visitor had been approved by the Hon. Fitzroy Bagley, Mr.
Ryder's aristocratic private secretary, and to facilitate this
preliminary inspection there had been installed between the
library upstairs and the front door one of those ingenious
electric writing devices, such as are used in banks, on which a
name is hastily scribbled, instantly transmitted elsewhere,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page183" id="page183" title="183"></a>
immediately answered and the visitor promptly admitted or as
quickly shown the door.</p>

<p>Indeed the house, from the street, presented many of the
characteristics of a prison. It had massive doors behind a row of
highly polished steel gates, which would prove as useful in case
of attempted invasion as they were now ornamental, and heavily
barred windows, while on either side of the portico were great
marble columns hung with chains and surmounted with bronze lions
rampant. It was unusual to keep the town house open so late in the
summer, but Mr. Ryder was obliged for business reasons to be in
New York at this time, and Mrs. Ryder, who was one of the few
American wives who do not always get their own way, had
good-naturedly acquiesced in the wishes of her lord.</p>

<p>Jefferson did not have to ring at the paternal portal. The
sentinel within was at his post; no one could approach that door
without being seen and his arrival and appearance signalled
upstairs. But the great man's son headed the list of the
privileged ones, so without ado the smartly dressed flunkey opened
wide the doors and Jefferson was under his father's roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my father in?&rdquo; he demanded of the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; was the respectful answer. &ldquo;Mr.
Ryder has gone out driving, but Mr. Bagley is upstairs.&rdquo;
<a class="pagebreak" name="page184" id="page184" title="184"></a>
Then after a brief pause he added: &ldquo;Mrs. Ryder is in,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this household where the personality of the mistress was so
completely overshadowed by the stronger personality of the master
the latter's secretary was a more important personage to the
servants than the unobtrusive wife.</p>

<p>Jefferson went up the grand staircase hung on either side with
fine old portraits and rare tapestries, his feet sinking deep in
the rich velvet carpet. On the first landing was a piece of
sculptured marble of inestimable worth, seen in the soft warm
light that sifted through a great pictorial stained-glass window
overhead, the subject representing Ajax and Ulysses contending for
the armour of Achilles. To the left of this, at the top of another
flight leading to the library, was hung a fine full-length
portrait of John Burkett Ryder. The ceilings here as in the lower
hall were richly gilt and adorned with paintings by famous modern
artists. When he reached this floor Jefferson was about to turn
to the right and proceed direct to his mother's suite when he
heard a voice near the library door. It was Mr. Bagley giving
instructions to the butler.</p>

<p>The Honourable Fitzroy Bagley, a younger son of a British peer,
had left his country for his country's good, and in order to turn
an honest penny, which
<a class="pagebreak" name="page185" id="page185" title="185"></a>
he had never succeeded in doing at home, he had entered the
service of America's foremost financier, hoping to gather a few of
the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table and disguising the
menial nature of his position under the high-sounding title of
private secretary. His job called for a spy and a toady and he
filled these requirements admirably. Excepting with his employer,
of whom he stood in craven fear, his manner was condescendingly
patronizing to all with whom he came in contact, as if he were
anxious to impress on these American plebeians the signal honour
which a Fitzroy, son of a British peer, did them in deigning to
remain in their &ldquo;blarsted&rdquo; country. In Mr. Ryder's
absence, therefore, he ran the house to suit himself, bullying the
servants and not infrequently issuing orders that were
contradictory to those already given by Mrs. Ryder. The latter
offered no resistance, she knew he was useful to her husband and,
what to her mind was a still better reason for letting him have
his own way, she had always had the greatest reverence for the
British aristocracy. It would have seemed to her little short of
vulgarity to question the actions of anyone who spoke with such a
delightful English accent. Moreover, he dressed with
irreproachable taste, was an acknowledged authority on dinner
menus and social functions and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page186" id="page186" title="186"></a>
knew his Burke backwards&mdash;altogether an accomplished and
invaluable person.</p>

<p>Jefferson could not bear the sight of him; in fact, it was this
man's continual presence in the house that had driven him to seek
refuge elsewhere. He believed him to be a scoundrel as he
certainly was a cad. Nor was his estimate of the English
secretary far wrong. The man, like his master, was a grafter, and
the particular graft he was after now was either to make a
marriage with a rich American girl or to so compromise her that
the same end would be attained. He was shrewd enough to realize
that he had little chance to get what he wanted in the open
matrimonial market, so he determined to attempt a raid and carry
off an heiress under her father's nose, and the particular
proboscis he had selected was that of his employer's friend,
Senator Roberts. The senator and Miss Roberts were frequently at
the Ryder House and in course of time the aristocratic secretary
and the daughter had become quite intimate. A flighty girl, with
no other purpose in life beyond dress and amusement and having
what she termed &ldquo;a good time,&rdquo; Kate thought it
excellent pastime to flirt with Mr. Bagley, and when she
discovered that he was serious in his attentions she felt
flattered rather than indignant. After all, she argued, he was of
noble birth. If his
<a class="pagebreak" name="page187" id="page187" title="187"></a>
two brothers died he would be peer of England, and she had enough
money for both. He might not make a bad husband. But she was
careful to keep her own counsel and not let her father have any
suspicion of what was going on. She knew that his heart was set on
her marrying Jefferson Ryder and she knew better than anyone how
impossible that dream was. She herself liked Jefferson quite
enough to marry him, but if his eyes were turned in another
direction&mdash;and she knew all about his attentions to Miss
Rossmore&mdash;she was not going to break her heart about it. So
she continued to flirt secretly with the Honourable Fitzroy while
she still led the Ryders and her own father to think that she was
interested in Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jorkins,&rdquo; Mr. Bagley was saying to the butler,
&ldquo;Mr. Ryder will occupy the library on his return. See that
he is not disturbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the butler respectfully. The
man turned to go when the secretary called him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, Jorkins, you will station another man at the front
entrance. Yesterday it was left unguarded, and a man had the
audacity to address Mr. Ryder as he was getting out of his
carriage. Last week a reporter tried to snapshot him. Mr. Ryder
was furious. These things must not happen again, Jorkins. I shall
hold you responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page188" id="page188" title="188"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo; The butler bowed and went
downstairs. The secretary looked up and saw Jefferson. His face
reddened and his manner grew nervous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! Back from Europe, Jefferson? How jolly! Your
mother will be delighted. She's in her room upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Declining to take the hint, and gathering from Bagley's
embarrassed manner that he wanted to get rid of him, Jefferson
lingered purposely. When the butler had disappeared, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This house is getting more and more like a barracks
every day. You've got men all over the place. One can't move a
step without falling over one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley drew himself up stiffly, as he always did when
assuming an air of authority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father's personality demands the utmost
precaution,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We cannot leave the life of
the richest and most powerful financier in the world at the mercy
of the rabble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What rabble?&rdquo; inquired Jefferson, amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The common rabble&mdash;the lower class&mdash;the
riff-raff,&rdquo; explained Mr. Bagley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; laughed Jefferson. &ldquo;If our
financiers were only half as respectable as the common rabble,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page189" id="page189" title="189"></a>
as you call them, they would need no bars to their
houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley sneered and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father has warned me against your socialistic
views.&rdquo; Then, with a lofty air, he added: &ldquo;For four
years I was third groom of the bedchamber to the second son of
England's queen. I know my responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are not groom of the bedchamber here,&rdquo;
retorted Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever I am,&rdquo; said Mr. Bagley haughtily,
&ldquo;I am answerable to your father alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Bagley,&rdquo; asked Jefferson, &ldquo;when
do you expect father to return? I want to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid it's quite impossible,&rdquo; answered the
secretary with studied insolence. &ldquo;He has three important
people to see before dinner. There's the National Republican
Committee and Sergeant Ellison of the Secret Service from
Washington&mdash;all here by appointment. It's quite
impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't ask you if it were possible. I said I wanted to
see him and I will see him,&rdquo; answered Jefferson quietly but
firmly, and in a tone and manner which did not admit of further
opposition. &ldquo;I'll go and leave word for him on his
desk,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>He started to enter the library when the secretary,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page190" id="page190" title="190"></a>
who was visibly perturbed, attempted to bar his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's some one in there,&rdquo; he said in an
undertone. &ldquo;Someone waiting for your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there?&rdquo; replied Jefferson coolly. &ldquo;I'll
see who it is,&rdquo; with which he brushed past Mr. Bagley and
entered the library.</p>

<p>He had guessed aright. A woman was there. It was Kate
Roberts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Kate! how are you?&rdquo; They called each other
by their first names, having been acquainted for years, and while
theirs was an indifferent kind of friendship they had always been
on good terms. At one time Jefferson had even begun to think he
might do what his father wished and marry the girl, but it was
only after he had met and known Shirley Rossmore that he realized
how different one woman can be from another. Yet Kate had her good
qualities. She was frivolous and silly as are most girls with no
brains and nothing else to do in life but dress and spend money,
but she might yet be happy with some other fellow, and that was
why it made him angry to see this girl with $100,000 in her own
right playing into the hands of an unscrupulous adventurer. He had
evidently disturbed an interesting <i>tête-à-tête</i>. He decided
to say nothing, but mentally he resolved to spoil
<a class="pagebreak" name="page191" id="page191" title="191"></a>
Mr. Bagley's game and save Kate from her own folly. On hearing
his voice Kate turned and gave a little cry of genuine
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, is it you, Jeff? I thought you were in
Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I returned yesterday,&rdquo; he replied somewhat curtly.
He crossed over to his father's desk where he sat down to scribble
a few words, while Mr. Bagley, who had followed him in scowling,
was making frantic dumb signs to Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I intrude here,&rdquo; said Jefferson
pointedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear no, not at all,&rdquo; replied Kate in some
confusion. &ldquo;I was waiting for my father. How is
Paris?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lovely as ever,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have a good time?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I enjoyed it immensely. I never had a better
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You probably were in good company,&rdquo; she said
significantly. Then she added: &ldquo;I believe Miss Rossmore was
in Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think she was there,&rdquo; was his non-committal
answer.</p>

<p>To change the conversation, which was becoming decidedly
personal, he picked up a book that was lying on his father's desk
and glanced at the title. It was &ldquo;The American
Octopus.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page192" id="page192" title="192"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Is father still reading this?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;He
was at it when I left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody is reading it,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;The
book has made a big sensation. Do you know who the hero
is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; he asked with an air of the greatest
innocence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no less a personage than your father&mdash;John
Burkett Ryder himself! Everybody says it's he&mdash;the press and
everybody that's read it. He says so himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he exclaimed with well-simulated
surprise. &ldquo;I must read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has made a strong impression on Mr. Ryder,&rdquo;
chimed in Mr. Bagley. &ldquo;I never knew him to be so interested
in a book before. He's trying his best to find out who the author
is. It's a jolly well written book and raps you American
millionaires jolly well&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever wrote the book,&rdquo; interrupted Kate,
&ldquo;is somebody who knows Mr. Ryder exceedingly well. There
are things in it that an outsider could not possibly
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; Jefferson whistled softly to himself. He
was treading dangerous ground. To conceal his embarrassment, he
rose.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page193" id="page193" title="193"></a>
<p>&ldquo;If you'll excuse me, I'll go and pay my filial respects
upstairs. I'll see you again,&rdquo; He gave Kate a friendly nod,
and without even glancing at Mr. Bagley left the room.</p>

<p>The couple stood in silence for a few moments after he
disappeared. Then Kate went to the door and listened to his
retreating footsteps. When she was sure that he was out of earshot
she turned on Mr. Bagley indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see what you expose me to. Jefferson thinks this was
a rendezvous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was to a certain extent,&rdquo; replied the
secretary unabashed. &ldquo;Didn't you ask me to see you
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kate, taking a letter from her bosom,
&ldquo;I wanted to ask you what this means?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss
Roberts&mdash;Kate&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;stammered the
secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you address me in this manner when you know I
and Mr. Ryder are engaged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one knew better than Kate that this was not true, but she
said it partly out of vanity, partly out of a desire to draw out
this Englishman who made such bold love to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Roberts,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bagley loftily,
&ldquo;in that note I expressed my admiration&mdash;my love for
you.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page194" id="page194" title="194"></a>
Your engagement to Mr. Jefferson Ryder is, to say the least, a
most uncertain fact.&rdquo; There was a tinge of sarcasm in his
voice that did not escape Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not judge from appearances,&rdquo; she
answered, trying to keep up the outward show of indignation which
inwardly she did not feel. &ldquo;Jeff and I may hide a passion
that burns like a volcano. All lovers are not demonstrative, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The absurdity of this description as applied to her relations
with Jefferson appealed to her as so comical that she burst into
laughter in which the secretary joined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why did you remain here with me when the Senator
went out with Mr. Ryder, senior?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell you that I cannot listen to your nonsense any
longer,&rdquo; retorted the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he cried, incredulously. &ldquo;You remain
here to tell me that you cannot listen to me when you could easily
have avoided listening to me without telling me so. Kate, your
coldness is not convincing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you think I want to listen to you?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he answered, stepping forward as if to take
her in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bagley!&rdquo; she exclaimed, recoiling.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page195" id="page195" title="195"></a>
<p>&ldquo;A week ago,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;you called me
Fitzroy. Once, in an outburst of confidence, you called me
Fitz.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hadn't asked me to marry you then,&rdquo; she
laughed mockingly. Then edging away towards the door she waved her
hand at him playfully and said teasingly: &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr.
Bagley, I am going upstairs to Mrs. Ryder. I will await my
father's return in her room. I think I shall be safer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran forward to intercept her, but she was too quick for him.
The door slammed in his face and she was gone.</p>

<p>Meantime Jefferson had proceeded upstairs, passing through long
and luxuriously carpeted corridors with panelled frescoed walls,
and hung with grand old tapestries and splendid paintings, until
he came to his mother's room. He knocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; called out the familiar voice.</p>

<p>He entered. Mrs. Ryder was busy at her escritoire looking over
a mass of household accounts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, mother!&rdquo; he cried, running up and hugging
her in his boyish, impulsive way. Jefferson had always been
devoted to his mother, and while he deplored her weakness in
permitting herself to be so completely under the domination of his
father, she had always found him an affectionate and loving
son.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page196" id="page196" title="196"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Jefferson!&rdquo; she exclaimed when he released her.
&ldquo;My dear boy, when did you arrive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only yesterday. I slept at the studio last night.
You're looking bully, mother. How's father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryder sighed while she looked her son over proudly. In her
heart she was glad Jefferson had turned out as he had. Her boy
certainly would never be a financier to be attacked in magazines
and books. Answering his question she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father is as well as those busybodies in the
newspapers will let him be. He's considerably worried just now
over that new book &lsquo;The American Octopus.&rsquo; How dare
they make him out such a monster? He's no worse than other
successful business men. He's richer, that's all, and it makes
them jealous. He's out driving now with Senator Roberts. Kate is
somewhere in the house&mdash;in the library, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I found her there,&rdquo; replied Jefferson dryly.
&ldquo;She was with that cad, Bagley. When is father going to find
that fellow out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jefferson,&rdquo; protested his mother, &ldquo;how
can you talk like that of Mr. Bagley. He is such a perfect
gentleman. His family connections alone should entitle him to
respect. He is certainly the best secretary your father ever had.
I'm sure I don't know what we
<a class="pagebreak" name="page197" id="page197" title="197"></a>
should do without him. He knows everything that a gentleman
should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a good deal more, I wager,&rdquo; growled Jefferson.
&ldquo;He wasn't groom of the backstairs to England's queen for
nothing.&rdquo; Then changing the topic, he said suddenly:
&ldquo;Talking about Kate, mother, we have got to reach some
definite understanding. This talk about my marrying her must stop.
I intend to take the matter up with father to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, more trouble!&rdquo; replied his mother
in a resigned tone. She was so accustomed to having her wishes
thwarted that she was never surprised at anything. &ldquo;We heard
of your goings on in Paris. That Miss Rossmore was there, was she
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That has got nothing to do with it,&rdquo; replied
Jefferson warmly. He resented Shirley's name being dragged into
the discussion. Then more calmly he went on: &ldquo;Now, mother,
be reasonable, listen. I purpose to live my own life. I have
already shown my father that I will not be dictated to, and that I
can earn my own living. He has no right to force this marriage on
me. There has never been any misunderstanding on Kate's part. She
and I understand each other thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jefferson, you may be right from your point of
view,&rdquo; replied his mother weakly. She invariably
<a class="pagebreak" name="page198" id="page198" title="198"></a>
ended by agreeing with the last one who argued with her.
&ldquo;You are of age, of course. Your parents have only a moral
right over you. Only remember this: it would be foolish of you to
do anything now to anger your father. His interests are your
interests. Don't do anything to jeopardize them. Of course, you
can't be forced to marry a girl you don't care for, but your
father will be bitterly disappointed. He had set his heart on this
match. He knows all about your infatuation for Miss Rossmore and
it has made him furious. I suppose you've heard about her
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it's a dastardly outrage,&rdquo; blurted out
Jefferson. &ldquo;It's a damnable conspiracy against one of the
most honourable men that ever lived, and I mean to ferret out and
expose the authors. I came here to-day to ask father to help
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came to ask your father to help you?&rdquo; echoed
his mother incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Jefferson. &ldquo;Is it true
then that he is selfishness incarnate? Wouldn't he do that much to
help a friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've come to the wrong house, Jeff. You ought to know
that. Your father is far from being Judge Rossmore's friend.
Surely you have sense enough to realize that there are two reasons
why he would not raise a finger to help him. One is that he has
always
<a class="pagebreak" name="page199" id="page199" title="199"></a>
been his opponent in public life, the other is that you want to
marry his daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson sat as if struck dumb. He had not thought of that.
Yes, it was true. His father and the father of the girl he loved
were mortal enemies. How was help to be expected from the head of
those &ldquo;interests&rdquo; which the judge had always attacked,
and now he came to think of it, perhaps his own father was really
at the bottom of these abominable charges! He broke into a cold
perspiration and his voice was altered as he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see now, mother. You are right.&rdquo; Then he
added bitterly: &ldquo;That has always been the trouble at home.
No matter where I turn, I am up against a stone wall&mdash;the
money interests. One never hears a glimmer of fellow-feeling,
never a word of human sympathy, only cold calculation, heartless
reasoning, money, money, money! Oh, I am sick of it. I don't want
any of it. I am going away where I'll hear no more of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother laid her hand gently on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't talk that way, Jefferson. Your father is not a bad
man at heart, you know that. His life has been devoted to money
making and he has made a greater fortune than any man living or
dead. He is only what his life has made him. He has a good heart.
And
<a class="pagebreak" name="page200" id="page200" title="200"></a>
he loves you&mdash;his only son. But his business
enemies&mdash;ah! those he never forgives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson was about to reply when suddenly a dozen electric
bells sounded all over the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; exclaimed Jefferson, alarmed, and
starting towards the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that's nothing,&rdquo; smiled his mother. &ldquo;We
have had that put in since you went away. Your father must have
just come in. Those bells announce the fact. It was done so that
if there happened to be any strangers in the house they could be
kept out of the way until he reached the library
safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; laughed Jefferson, &ldquo;he's afraid some
one will kidnap him? Certainly he would be a rich prize. I
wouldn't care for the job myself, though. They'd be catching a
tartar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His speech was interrupted by a timid knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in to say good-bye?&rdquo; asked a voice
which they recognized as Kate's. She had successfully escaped from
Mr. Bagley's importunities and was now going home with the
Senator. She smiled amiably at Jefferson and they chatted
pleasantly of his trip abroad. He was sincerely sorry for this
girl whom they were trying to foist on him. Not that he thought
she really cared for him, he was well aware that hers was a
<a class="pagebreak" name="page201" id="page201" title="201"></a>
nature that made it impossible to feel very deeply on any subject,
but the idea of this ready-made marriage was so foreign, so
revolting to the American mind! He thought it would be a kindness
to warn her against Bagley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be foolish, Kate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was not
blind just now in the library. That man is no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As is usual when one's motives are suspected, the girl resented
his interference. She knew he hated Mr. Bagley and she thought it
mean of him to try and get even in this way. She stiffened up and
replied coldly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I am able to look after myself, Jefferson.
Thanks, all the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and made no reply. She said good-bye
to Mrs. Ryder, who was again immersed in her tradespeople bills,
and left the room, escorted by Jefferson, who accompanied her
downstairs and on to the street where Senator Roberts was waiting
for her in the open victoria. The senator greeted with unusual
cordiality the young man whom he still hoped to make his
son-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and see us, Jefferson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come
to dinner any evening. We are always alone and Kate and I will be
glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jefferson has so little time now, father. His work
and&mdash;his friends keep him pretty busy,&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page202" id="page202" title="202"></a>
<p>Jefferson had noted both the pause and the sarcasm, but he said
nothing. He smiled and the senator raised his hat. As the carriage
drove off the young man noticed that Kate glanced at one of the
upper windows where Mr. Bagley stood behind a curtain watching.
Jefferson returned to the house. The psychological moment had
arrived. He must go now and confront his father in the
library.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page203" id="page203" title="203"></a>
<a name="chapter9" id="chapter9"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>The library was the most important room in the Ryder mansion,
for it was there that the Colossus carried through his most
important business deals, and its busiest hours were those which
most men devote to rest. But John Burkett Ryder never rested.
There could be no rest for any man who had a thousand millions of
dollars to take care of. Like Macbeth, he could sleep no more.
When the hum of business life had ceased down town and he returned
home from the tall building in lower Broadway, then his real work
began. The day had been given to mere business routine; in his own
library at night, free from inquisitive ears and prying eyes, he
could devise new schemes for strengthening his grip upon the
country, he could evolve more gigantic plans for adding to his
already countless millions.</p>

<p>Here the money Moloch held court like any king, with as much
ceremony and more secrecy, and having for his courtiers some of
the most prominent men in the political and industrial life of the
nation. Corrupt senators, grafting Congressmen, ambitious railroad
<a class="pagebreak" name="page204" id="page204" title="204"></a>
presidents, insolent coal barons who impudently claimed they
administered the coal lands in trust for the Almighty,
unscrupulous princes of finance and commerce, all visited this
room to receive orders or pay from the head of the
&ldquo;System.&rdquo; Here were made and unmade governors of
States, mayors of cities, judges, heads of police, cabinet
ministers, even presidents. Here were turned over to confidential
agents millions of dollars to overturn the people's vote in the
National elections; here were distributed yearly hundreds of
thousands of dollars to grafters, large and small, who had earned
it in the service of the &ldquo;interests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here, secretly and unlawfully, the heads of railroads met to
agree on rates which by discriminating against one locality in
favour of another crushed out competition, raised the cost to the
consumer, and put millions in the pockets of the Trust. Here were
planned tricky financial operations, with deliberate intent to
mislead and deceive the investing public, operations which would
send stocks soaring one day, only a week later to put Wall Street
on the verge of panic. Half a dozen suicides might result from the
coup, but twice as many millions of profits had gone into the
coffers of the &ldquo;System.&rdquo; Here, too, was perpetrated
the most heinous crime that can be committed against a
<a class="pagebreak" name="page205" id="page205" title="205"></a>
free people&mdash;the conspiring of the Trusts abetted by the
railroads, to arbitrarily raise the prices of the necessaries of
life&mdash;meat, coal, oil, ice, gas&mdash;wholly without other
justification than that of greed, which, with these men, was the
unconquerable, all-absorbing passion. In short, everything that
unscrupulous leaders of organized capital could devise to squeeze
the life blood out of the patient, defenceless toiler was done
within these four walls.</p>

<p>It was a handsome room, noble in proportions and abundantly
lighted by three large and deeply recessed, mullioned windows, one
in the middle of the room and one at either end. The lofty ceiling
was a marvellously fine example of panelled oak of Gothic design,
decorated with gold, and the shelves for books which lined the
walls were likewise of oak, richly carved. In the centre of the
wall facing the windows was a massive and elaborately designed oak
chimney-piece, reaching up to the ceiling, and having in the
middle panel over the mantel a fine three-quarter length portrait
of George Washington. The room was furnished sumptuously yet
quietly, and fully in keeping with the rich collection of classic
and modern authors that filled the bookcases, and in corners here
and there stood pedestals with marble busts of Shakespeare, Goethe
and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page206" id="page206" title="206"></a>
Voltaire. It was the retreat of a scholar rather than of a man of
affairs.</p>

<p>When Jefferson entered, his father was seated at his desk, a
long black cigar between his lips, giving instructions to Mr.
Bagley. Mr. Ryder looked up quickly as the door opened and the
secretary made a movement forward as if to eject the intruder, no
matter who he might be. They were not accustomed to having people
enter the sanctum of the Colossus so unceremoniously. But when he
saw who it was, Mr. Ryder's stern, set face relaxed and he greeted
his son amiably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jeff, my boy, is that you? Just a moment, until I
get rid of Bagley, and I'll be with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson turned to the book shelves and ran over the titles
while the financier continued his business with the secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Bagley. Come, quick. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke in a rapid, explosive manner, like a man who has only
a few moments to spare before he must rush to catch a train. John
Ryder had been catching trains all his life, and he had seldom
missed one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Governor Rice called. He wants an appointment,&rdquo;
said Mr. Bagley, holding out a card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't see him. Tell him so,&rdquo; came the answer,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page207" id="page207" title="207"></a>
quick as a flash. &ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Where's your list?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley took from the desk a list of names and read them
over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;General Abbey telephoned. He says you
promised&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; interrupted Ryder impatiently,
&ldquo;but not here. Down town, to-morrow, any time.
Next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The secretary jotted down a note against each name and then
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some people downstairs in the reception room.
They are here by appointment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The National Republican Committee and Sergeant Ellison
of the Secret Service from Washington,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Bagley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was here first?&rdquo; demanded the financier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Ellison, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'll see him first, and the Committee afterwards.
But let them all wait until I ring. I wish to speak with my
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waved his hand and the secretary, knowing well from
experience that this was a sign that there must be no further
discussion, bowed respectfully and left the room. Jefferson turned
and advanced towards his father, who held out his hand.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page208" id="page208" title="208"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jefferson,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;did you
have a good time abroad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, thank you. Such a trip is a liberal education
in itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready for work again, eh? I'm glad you're back,
Jefferson. I'm busy now, but one of these days I want to have a
serious talk with you in regard to your future. This artist
business is all very well&mdash;for a pastime. But it's not a
career&mdash;surely you can appreciate that&mdash;for a young man
with such prospects as yours. Have you ever stopped to think of
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson was silent. He did not want to displease his father;
on the other hand, it was impossible to let things drift as they
had been doing. There must be an understanding sooner or later.
Why not now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is, sir,&rdquo; he began timidly, &ldquo;I'd
like a little talk with you now, if you can spare the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., looked first at his watch and then at his son, who,
ill at ease, sat nervously on the extreme edge of a chair. Then he
said with a smile:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my boy, to be perfectly frank, I
can't&mdash;but&mdash;I will. Come, what is it?&rdquo; Then, as if
to apologize for his previous abruptness, he added, &ldquo;I've
had a very busy day, Jeff. What with Trans-Continental and
Trans-Atlantic and Southern Pacific, and Wall
<a class="pagebreak" name="page209" id="page209" title="209"></a>
Street, and Rate Bills, and Washington I feel like Atlas
shouldering the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world wasn't intended for one pair of shoulders to
carry, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Jefferson calmly.</p>

<p>His father looked at him in amazement. It was something new to
hear anyone venturing to question or comment upon anything he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded, when he had recovered from
his surprise. &ldquo;Julius C&aelig;sar carried it. Napoleon
carried it&mdash;to a certain extent. However, that's neither here
nor there. What is it, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unable to remain a moment inactive, he commenced to pick among
the mass of papers on his desk, while Jefferson was thinking what
to say. The last word his father uttered gave him a cue, and he
blurted out protestingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just it, sir. You forget that I'm no longer a
boy. It's time to treat me as if I were a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man at twenty-eight? That's an excellent joke. Do you
know that a man doesn't get his horse sense till he's
forty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to take me seriously,&rdquo; persisted
Jefferson.</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., was not a patient man. His moments
<a class="pagebreak" name="page210" id="page210" title="210"></a>
of good humour were of brief duration. Anything that savoured of
questioning his authority always angered him. The smile went out
of his face and he retorted explosively:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on&mdash;damn it all! Be serious if you want, only
don't take so long about it. But understand one thing. I want no
preaching, no philosophical or socialistic twaddle. No
Tolstoi&mdash;he's a great thinker, and you're not. No Bernard
Shaw&mdash;he's funny, and you're not. Now go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This beginning was not very encouraging, and Jefferson felt
somewhat intimidated. But he realized that he might not have
another such opportunity, so he plunged right in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have spoken to you before if you had let
me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I often&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I let you?&rdquo; interrupted his father. &ldquo;Do
you expect me to sit and listen patiently to your wild theories of
social reform? You asked me one day why the wages of the idle rich
was wealth and the wages of hard work was poverty, and I told you
that I worked harder in one day than a tunnel digger works in a
life-time. Thinking is a harder game than any. You must think or
you won't know. Napoleon knew more about war than all his generals
put together. I know more about money than any man
<a class="pagebreak" name="page211" id="page211" title="211"></a>
living to-day. The man who knows is the man who wins. The man who
takes advice isn't fit to give it. That's why I never take yours.
Come, don't be a fool, Jeff&mdash;give up this art nonsense. Come
back to the Trading Company. I'll make you vice-president, and
I'll teach you the business of making millions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson shook his head. It was hard to have to tell his own
father that he did not think the million-making business quite a
respectable one, so he only murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's impossible, father. I am devoted to my work. I
even intend to go away and travel a few years and see the world.
It will help me considerably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., eyed his son in silence for a few moments; then he
said gently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be obstinate, Jeff. Listen to me. I know the world
better than you do. You mustn't go away. You are the only flesh
and blood I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped speaking for a moment, as if overcome by a sudden
emotion over which he had no control. Jefferson remained silent,
nervously toying with a paper cutter. Seeing that his words had
made no effect, Ryder thumped his desk with his fist and
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see my weakness. You see that I want you with me,
and now you take advantage&mdash;you take
advantage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page212" id="page212" title="212"></a>
<p>&ldquo;No, father, I don't,&rdquo; protested Jefferson;
&ldquo;but I want to go away. Although I have my studio and am
practically independent, I want to go where I shall be perfectly
free&mdash;where my every move will not be watched&mdash;where I
can meet my fellow-man heart to heart on an equal basis, where I
shall not be pointed out as the son of Ready Money Ryder. I want
to make a reputation of my own as an artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not study theology and become a preacher?&rdquo;
sneered Ryder. Then, more amiably, he said: &ldquo;No, my lad, you
stay here. Study my interests&mdash;study the interests that will
be yours some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jefferson doggedly, &ldquo;I'd rather
go&mdash;my work and my self-respect demand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then go, damn it, go!&rdquo; cried his father in a burst
of anger. &ldquo;I'm a fool for wasting my time with an ungrateful
son.&rdquo; He rose from his seat and began to pace the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; exclaimed Jefferson starting forward,
&ldquo;you do me an injustice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An injustice?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Ryder turning round.
&ldquo;Ye gods! I've given you the biggest name in the commercial
world; the most colossal fortune ever accumulated by one man is
waiting for you, and you say I've done you an
injustice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;we are rich,&rdquo; said Jefferson bitterly.
&ldquo;But
<a class="pagebreak" name="page213" id="page213" title="213"></a>
at what a cost! You do not go into the world and hear the sneers
that I get everywhere. You may succeed in muzzling the newspapers
and magazines, but you cannot silence public opinion. People laugh
when they hear the name Ryder&mdash;when they do not weep. All
your millions cannot purchase the world's respect. You try to
throw millions to the public as a bone to a dog, and they decline
the money on the ground that it is tainted. Doesn't that tell you
what the world thinks of your methods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder laughed cynically. He went back to his desk, and, sitting
facing his son, he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jefferson, you are young. It is one of the symptoms of
youth to worry about public opinion. When you are as old as I am
you will understand that there is only one thing which counts in
this world&mdash;money. The man who has it possesses power over
the man who has it not, and power is what the ambitious man loves
most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped to pick up a book. It was &ldquo;The American
Octopus.&rdquo; Turning again to his son, he went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see this book? It is the literary sensation of
the year. Why? Because it attacks me&mdash;the richest man in the
world. It holds me up as a monster, a tyrant, a man without soul,
honour or conscience, caring only for one thing&mdash;money;
having but one passion&mdash;the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page214" id="page214" title="214"></a>
love of power, and halting at nothing, not even at crime, to
secure it. That is the portrait they draw of your
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson said nothing. He was wondering if his sire had a
suspicion who wrote it and was leading up to that. But Ryder, Sr.,
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I care? The more they attack me the more I like it.
Their puny pen pricks have about the same effect as mosquito bites
on the pachyderm. What I am, the conditions of my time made me.
When I started in business a humble clerk, forty years ago, I had
but one goal&mdash;success; I had but one aim&mdash;to get rich. I
was lucky. I made a little money, and I soon discovered that I
could make more money by outwitting my competitors in the oil
fields. Railroad conditions helped me. The whole country was money
mad. A wave of commercial prosperity swept over the land and I was
carried along on its crest. I grew enormously rich, my millions
increasing by leaps and bounds. I branched out into other
interests, successful always, until my holdings grew to what they
are to-day&mdash;the wonder of the twentieth century. What do I
care for the world's respect when my money makes the world my
slave? What respect can I have for a people that cringe before
money and let it rule them? Are you aware that not a factory wheel
<a class="pagebreak" name="page215" id="page215" title="215"></a>
turns, not a vote is counted, not a judge is appointed, not a
legislator seated, not a president elected without my consent? I
am the real ruler of the United States&mdash;not the so-called
government at Washington. They are my puppets and this is my
executive chamber. This power will be yours one day, boy, but you
must know how to use it when it comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never want it, father,&rdquo; said Jefferson firmly.
&ldquo;To me your words savour of treason. I couldn't imagine that
American talking that way.&rdquo; He pointed to the mantel, at the
picture of George Washington.</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., laughed. He could not help it if his son was an
idealist. There was no use getting angry, so he merely shrugged
his shoulders and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Jeff. We'll discuss the matter later, when
you've cut your wisdom teeth. Just at present you're in the
clouds. But you spoke of my doing you an injustice. How can my
love of power do you an injustice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Jefferson, &ldquo;you exert that
power over your family as well as over your business associates.
You think and will for everybody in the house, for everyone who
comes in contact with you. Yours is an influence no one seems able
to resist. You robbed me of my right to think. Ever since I was
old enough to think, you have thought for me; ever since I was
<a class="pagebreak" name="page216" id="page216" title="216"></a>
old enough to choose, you have chosen for me. You have chosen that
I should marry Kate Roberts. That is the one thing I wished to
speak to you about. The marriage is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., half sprang from his seat. He had listened
patiently, he thought, to all that his headstrong son had said,
but that he should repudiate in this unceremonious fashion what
was a tacit understanding between the two families, and, what was
more, run the risk of injuring the Ryder interests&mdash;that was
inconceivable. Leaving his desk, he advanced into the centre of
the room, and folding his arms confronted Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;this is your latest
act of rebellion, is it? You are going to welsh on your word? You
are going to jilt the girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never gave my word,&rdquo; answered Jefferson hotly.
&ldquo;Nor did Kate understand that an engagement existed. You
can't expect me to marry a girl I don't care a straw about. It
would not be fair to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you stopped to think whether it would be fair to
me?&rdquo; thundered his father.</p>

<p>His face was pale with anger, his jet-black eyes flashed, and
his white hair seemed to bristle with rage. He paced the floor
for a few moments, and then turning
<a class="pagebreak" name="page217" id="page217" title="217"></a>
to Jefferson, who had not moved, he said more calmly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be a fool, Jeff. I don't want to think for you, or
to choose for you, or to marry for you. I did not interfere when
you threw up the position I made for you in the Trading Company
and took that studio. I realized that you were restless under the
harness, so I gave you plenty of rein. But I know so much better
than you what is best for you. Believe me I do. Don't&mdash;don't
be obstinate. This marriage means a great deal to my
interests&mdash;to your interests. Kate's father is all powerful
in the Senate. He'll never forgive this disappointment. Hang it
all, you liked the girl once, and I made sure
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and the expression on his face changed as
a new light dawned upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn't that Rossmore girl, is it?&rdquo; he demanded.
His face grew dark and his jaw clicked as he said between his
teeth: &ldquo;I told you some time ago how I felt about her. If I
thought that it was Rossmore's daughter! You know what's going to
happen to him, don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Jefferson thought this was the most
favourable opportunity he would have to redeem his promise to
Shirley. So, little anticipating the tempest he was about to
unchain, he answered:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page218" id="page218" title="218"></a>
<p>&ldquo;I am familiar with the charges that they have trumped up
against him. Needless to say, I consider him entirely innocent.
What's more, I firmly believe he is the victim of a contemptible
conspiracy. And I'm going to make it my business to find out who
the plotters are. I came to ask you to help me. Will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Ryder was speechless from utter astonishment.
Then, as he realized the significance of his son's words and their
application to himself he completely lost control of himself. His
face became livid, and he brought his fist down on his desk with a
force that shook the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see him in hell first!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Damn him! He has always opposed me. He has always defied my
power, and now his daughter has entrapped my son. So it's her you
want to go to, eh? Well, I can't make you marry a girl you don't
want, but I can prevent you throwing yourself away on the daughter
of a man who is about to be publicly disgraced, and, by God, I
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old Rossmore,&rdquo; said Jefferson bitterly.
&ldquo;If the history of every financial transaction were made
known, how many of us would escape public disgrace? Would
you?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., rose, his hands working dangerously.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page219" id="page219" title="219"></a>
He made a movement as if about to advance on his son, but by a
supreme effort he controlled himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, upon my word, it's no use disinheriting you, you
wouldn't care. I think you'd be glad; on my soul, I do!&rdquo;
Then calming down once more, he added: &ldquo;Jefferson, give me
your word of honour that your object in going away is not to find
out this girl and marry her unknown to me. I don't mind your
losing your heart, but, damn it, don't lose your head. Give me
your hand on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson reluctantly held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought you would marry that girl unknown to me,
I'd have Rossmore sent out of the country and the woman too.
Listen, boy. This man is my enemy, and I show no mercy to my
enemies. There are more reasons than one why you cannot marry Miss
Rossmore. If she knew one of them she would not marry
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What reasons?&rdquo; demanded Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The principal one,&rdquo; said Ryder, slowly and
deliberately, and eyeing his son keenly as if to judge of the
effect of his words, &ldquo;the principal one is that it was
through my agents that the demand was made for her father's
impeachment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Jefferson, &ldquo;then I guessed
aright!
<a class="pagebreak" name="page220" id="page220" title="220"></a>
Oh, father, how could you have done that? If you only knew
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., had regained command of his temper, and now spoke
calmly enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jefferson, I don't have to make any apologies to you for
the way I conduct my business. The facts contained in the charge
were brought to my attention. I did not see why I should spare
him. He never spared me. I shall not interfere, and the
probabilities are that he will be impeached. Senator Roberts said
this afternoon that it was a certainty. You see yourself how
impossible a marriage with Miss Rossmore would be, don't
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, father, I see now. I have nothing more to
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you still intend going away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jefferson bitterly. &ldquo;Why not?
You have taken away the only reason why I should stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think it well over, lad. Marry Kate or not, as you
please, but I want you to stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's no use. My mind is made up,&rdquo; answered
Jefferson decisively.</p>

<p>The telephone rang, and Jefferson got up to go. Mr. Ryder took
up the receiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo! What's that? Sergeant Ellison? Yes, send him
up.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page221" id="page221" title="221"></a>
<p>Putting the telephone down, Ryder, Sr., rose, and crossing the
room accompanied his son to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think it well over, Jeff. Don't be hasty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought it over, sir, and I have decided to
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few moments later Jefferson left the house.</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., went back to his desk and sat for a moment in deep
thought. For the first time in his life he was face to face with
defeat; for the first time he had encountered a will as strong as
his own. He who could rule parliaments and dictate to governments
now found himself powerless to rule his own son. At all costs, he
mused, the boy's infatuation for Judge Rossmore's daughter must be
checked, even if he had to blacken the girl's character as well as
the father's, or, as a last resort, send the entire family out of
the country. He had not lost sight of his victim since the
carefully prepared crash in Wall Street, and the sale of the
Rossmore home following the bankruptcy of the Great Northwestern
Mining Company. His agents had reported their settlement in the
quiet little village on Long Island, and he had also learned of
Miss Rossmore's arrival from Europe, which coincided strangely
with the home-coming of his own son. He decided, therefore, to
keep a closer watch on Massapequa now than ever, and that is why
to-day's call of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page222" id="page222" title="222"></a>
Sergeant Ellison, a noted sleuth in the government service, found
so ready a welcome.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Mr. Bagley entered, followed by a tall,
powerfully built man whose robust physique and cheap looking
clothes contrasted strangely with the delicate, ultra-fashionably
attired English secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a seat, Sergeant,&rdquo; said Mr. Ryder, cordially
motioning his visitor to a chair. The man sat down gingerly on one
of the rich leather-upholstered chairs. His manner was nervous
and awkward, as if intimidated in the presence of the
financier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the Republican Committee still waiting?&rdquo;
demanded Mr. Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll see them in a few minutes. Leave me with Sergeant
Ellison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley bowed and retired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sergeant, what have you got to report?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened a box of cigars that stood on the desk and held it
out to the detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a cigar,&rdquo; he said amiably.</p>

<p>The man took a cigar, and also the match which Mr. Ryder held
out. The financier knew how to be cordial with those who could
serve him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks. This is a good one,&rdquo; smiled the sleuth,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page223" id="page223" title="223"></a>
sniffing at the weed. &ldquo;We don't often get a chance at such
as these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ought to be good,&rdquo; laughed Ryder. &ldquo;They
cost two dollars apiece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detective was so surprised at this unheard of extravagance
that he inhaled a puff of smoke which almost choked him. It was
like burning money.</p>

<p>Ryder, with his customary bluntness, came right down to
business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you been doing about the book?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;Have you found the author of &lsquo;The American
Octopus&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I have not. I confess I'm baffled. The secret
has been well kept. The publishers have shut up like a clam.
There's only one thing that I'm pretty well sure of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; demanded Ryder, interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That no such person as Shirley Green exists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed the financier, &ldquo;then you
think it is a mere <i>nom de plume</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you think was the reason for preserving the
anonymity?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, sir, the book deals with a big subject.
It gives some hard knocks, and the author, no
<a class="pagebreak" name="page224" id="page224" title="224"></a>
doubt, felt a little timid about launching it under his or her
real name. At least that's my theory, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a good one, no doubt,&rdquo; said Mr. Ryder. Then he
added: &ldquo;That makes me all the more anxious to find out who
it is. I would willingly give this moment a check for $5,000 to
know who wrote it. Whoever it is, knows me as well as I know
myself. We must find the author.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sleuth was silent for a moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There might be one way to reach the author, but it will
be successful only in the event of her being willing to be known
and come out into the open. Suppose you write to her in care of
the publishers. They would certainly forward the letter to
wherever she may be. If she does not want you to know who she is
she will ignore your letter and remain in the background. If, on
the contrary, she has no fear of you, and is willing to meet you,
she will answer the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I never thought of that!&rdquo; exclaimed Ryder.
&ldquo;It's a good idea. I'll write such a letter at once. It
shall go to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He unhooked the telephone and asked Mr. Bagley to come up. A
few seconds later the secretary entered the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bagley,&rdquo; said Mr. Ryder, &ldquo;I want you to
write a letter for me to Miss Shirley Green, author of that
<a class="pagebreak" name="page225" id="page225" title="225"></a>
book &lsquo;The American Octopus.&rsquo; We will address it care
of her publishers, Littleton &amp; Co. Just say that if convenient
I should like a personal interview with her at my office, No. 36
Broadway, in relation to her book, &lsquo;The American
Octopus.&rsquo; See that it is mailed to-night. That's
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley bowed and retired. Mr. Ryder turned to the secret
service agent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, that's settled. We'll see how it works. And now,
Sergeant, I have another job for you, and if you are faithful to
my interests you will not find me unappreciative. Do you know a
little place on Long Island called Massapequa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; grinned the detective, &ldquo;I know it.
They've got some fine specimens of &lsquo;skeeters&rsquo;
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paying no attention to this jocularity, Mr. Ryder
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judge Rossmore is living there&mdash;pending the outcome
of his case in the Senate. His daughter has just arrived from
Europe. My son Jefferson came home on the same ship. They are a
little more friendly than I care to have them. You understand. I
want to know if my son visits the Rossmores, and if he does I wish
to be kept informed of all that's going on. You
understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, sir. You shall know everything.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page226" id="page226" title="226"></a>
<p>Mr. Ryder took a blank check from his desk and proceeded to
fill it up. Then handing it to the detective, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is $500 for you. Spare neither trouble or
expense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the man as he pocketed the
money. &ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's about all, I think. Regarding the other matter,
we'll see how the letter works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He touched a bell and rose, which was a signal to the visitor
that the interview was at an end. Mr. Bagley entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Ellison is going,&rdquo; said Mr. Ryder.
&ldquo;Have him shown out, and send the Republican Committee
up.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page227" id="page227" title="227"></a>
<a name="chapter10" id="chapter10"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Shirley, changing colour,
&ldquo;you believe that John Burkett Ryder is at the bottom of
this infamous accusation against father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the day following her arrival at Massapequa, and
Shirley, the judge and Stott were all three sitting on the porch.
Until now, by common consent, any mention of the impeachment
proceedings had been avoided by everyone. The previous afternoon
and evening had been spent listening to an account of Shirley's
experiences in Europe and a smile had flitted across even the
judge's careworn face as his daughter gave a humorous description
of the picturesque Paris students with their long hair and peg-top
trousers, while Stott simply roared with laughter. Ah, it was good
to laugh again after so much trouble and anxiety! But while
Shirley avoided the topic that lay nearest her heart, she was
consumed with a desire to tell her father of the hope she had of
enlisting the aid of John Burkett Ryder. The great financier was
certainly able to do anything he chose, and had not
<a class="pagebreak" name="page228" id="page228" title="228"></a>
his son Jefferson promised to win him over to their cause? So,
to-day, after Mrs. Rossmore and her sister had gone down to the
village to make some purchases Shirley timidly broached the
matter. She asked Stott and her father to tell her everything, to
hold back nothing. She wanted to hear the worst.</p>

<p>Stott, therefore, started to review the whole affair from the
beginning, explaining how her father in his capacity as Judge of
the Supreme Court had to render decisions, several of which were
adverse to the corporate interests of a number of rich men, and
how since that time these powerful interests had used all their
influence to get him put off the Bench. He told her about the
Transcontinental case and how the judge had got mysteriously
tangled up in the Great Northern Mining Company, and of the
scandalous newspaper rumours, followed by the news of the
Congressional inquiry. Then he told her about the panic in Wall
Street, the sale of the house on Madison Avenue and the removal to
Long Island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the situation,&rdquo; said Stott when he had
finished. &ldquo;We are waiting now to see what the Senate will
do. We hope for the best. It seems impossible that the Senate will
condemn a man whose whole life is like an open book, but
unfortunately the Senate is strongly Republican and the big
interests are in complete
<a class="pagebreak" name="page229" id="page229" title="229"></a>
control. Unless support comes from some unexpected quarter we must
be prepared for anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Support from some unexpected quarter! Stott's closing words
rang in Shirley's head. Was that not just what she had to offer?
Unable to restrain herself longer and her heart beating
tumultuously from suppressed emotion, she cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll have that support! We'll have it! I've got it
already! I wanted to surprise you! Father, the most powerful man
in the United States will save you from being
dishonoured!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men leaned forward in eager interest. What could the
girl mean? Was she serious or merely jesting?</p>

<p>But Shirley was never more serious in her life. She was
jubilant at the thought that she had arrived home in time to
invoke the aid of this powerful ally. She repeated
enthusiastically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need not worry any more. He has but to say a word and
these proceedings will be instantly dropped. They would not dare
act against his veto. Did you hear, father, your case is as good
as won!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, child? Who is this unknown
friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you can guess when I say the most powerful
<a class="pagebreak" name="page230" id="page230" title="230"></a>
man in the United States? None other than John Burkett
Ryder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped short to watch the effect which this name would
have on her hearers. But to her surprise neither her father nor
Stott displayed the slightest emotion or even interest. Puzzled at
this cold reception, she repeated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear, father&mdash;John Burkett Ryder will come
to your assistance. I came home on the same ship as his son and he
promised to secure his father's aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge puffed heavily at his pipe and merely shook his head,
making no reply. Stott explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can't look for help from that quarter, Shirley. You
don't expect a man to cut loose his own kite, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Shirley,
mystified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply this&mdash;that John Burkett Ryder is the very
man who is responsible for all your father's
misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl sank back in her seat pale and motionless, as if she
had received a blow. Was it possible? Could Jefferson's father
have done them such a wrong as this? She well knew that Ryder,
Sr., was a man who would stop at nothing to accomplish his
purpose&mdash;this
<a class="pagebreak" name="page231" id="page231" title="231"></a>
she had demonstrated conclusively in her book&mdash;but she had
never dreamed that his hand would ever be directed against her own
flesh and blood. Decidedly some fatality was causing Jefferson and
herself to drift further and further apart. First, her father's
trouble. That alone would naturally have separated them. And now
this discovery that Jefferson's father had done hers this wrong.
All idea of marriage was henceforth out of the question. That was
irrevocable. Of course, she could not hold Jefferson to blame for
methods which he himself abhorred. She would always think as much
of him as ever, but whether her father emerged safely from the
trial in the Senate or not&mdash;no matter what the outcome of the
impeachment proceedings might be, Jefferson could never be
anything else than a Ryder and from now on there would be an
impassable gulf between the Rossmores and the Ryders. The dove
does not mate with the hawk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe this, that John Ryder deliberately
concocted the bribery charge with the sole purpose of ruining my
father?&rdquo; demanded Shirley when she had somewhat
recovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no other solution of the mystery
possible,&rdquo; answered Stott. &ldquo;The Trusts found they
could not fight him in the open, in a fair, honest way, so
<a class="pagebreak" name="page232" id="page232" title="232"></a>
they plotted in the dark. Ryder was the man who had most to lose
by your father's honesty on the bench. Ryder was the man he hit
the hardest when he enjoined his Transcontinental Railroad. Ryder,
I am convinced, is the chief conspirator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can such things be in a civilized community?&rdquo;
cried Shirley indignantly. &ldquo;Cannot he be exposed, won't the
press take the matter up, cannot we show conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds easy, but it isn't,&rdquo; replied Stott.
&ldquo;I have had a heap of experience with the law, my child, and
I know what I'm talking about. They're too clever to be caught
tripping. They've covered their tracks well, be sure of that. As
to the newspapers&mdash;when did you ever hear of them championing
a man when he's down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, father&mdash;do you believe Ryder did
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no longer any doubt of it,&rdquo; answered the
judge. &ldquo;I think John Ryder would see me dead before he would
raise a finger to help me. His answer to my demand for my letters
convinced me that he was the arch plotter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What letters do you refer to?&rdquo; demanded
Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The letters I wrote to him in regard to my making an
investment. He advised the purchase of certain stock. I wrote him
two letters at the time, which letters
<a class="pagebreak" name="page233" id="page233" title="233"></a>
if I had them now would go a long way to clearing me of this
charge of bribery, for they plainly showed that I regarded the
transaction as a <i>bona fide</i> investment. Since this trouble
began I wrote to Ryder asking him to return me these letters so I
might use them in my defence. The only reply I got was an insolent
note from his secretary saying that Mr. Ryder had forgotten all
about the transaction, and in any case had not the letters I
referred to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn't you compel him to return them?&rdquo; asked
Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could never get at him,&rdquo; interrupted Stott.
&ldquo;The man is guarded as carefully as the Czar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; objected Shirley, &ldquo;it is possible
that he may have lost the letters or even never received
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he has them safe enough,&rdquo; replied Stott.
&ldquo;A man like Ryder keeps every scrap of paper, with the idea
that it may prove useful some day. The letters are lying somewhere
in his desk. Besides, after the Transcontinental decision he was
heard to say that he'd have Judge Rossmore off the Bench inside of
a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it wasn't a vain boast&mdash;he's done it,&rdquo;
muttered the judge.</p>

<p>Shirley relapsed into silence. Her brain was in a whirl. It was
true then. This merciless man of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page234" id="page234" title="234"></a>
money, this ogre of monopolistic corporations, this human
juggernaut had crushed her father merely because by his honesty he
interfered with his shady business deals! Ah, why had she spared
him in her book? She felt now that she had been too lenient, not
bitter enough, not sufficiently pitiless. Such a man was entitled
to no mercy. Yes, it was all clear enough now. John Burkett
Ryder, the head of &ldquo;the System,&rdquo; the plutocrat whose
fabulous fortune gave him absolute control over the entire
country, which invested him with a personal power greater than
that of any king, this was the man who now dared attack the
Judiciary, the corner stone of the Constitution, the one safeguard
of the people's liberty. Where would it end? How long would the
nation tolerate being thus ruthlessly trodden under the unclean
heels of an insolent oligarchy? The capitalists, banded together
for the sole purpose of pillage and loot, had already succeeded in
enslaving the toiler. The appalling degradation of the working
classes, the sordidness and demoralizing squalor in which they
passed their lives, the curse of drink, the provocation to crime,
the shame of the sweat shops&mdash;all which evils in our social
system she had seen as a Settlement worker, were directly
traceable to Centralized Wealth. The labor unions regulated wages
and hours, but they were powerless to
<a class="pagebreak" name="page235" id="page235" title="235"></a>
control the prices of the necessaries of life. The Trusts could at
pleasure create famine or plenty. They usually willed to make it
famine so they themselves might acquire more millions with which
to pay for marble palaces, fast motor cars, ocean-going yachts and
expensive establishments at Newport. Food was ever dearer and of
poorer quality, clothes cost more, rents and taxes were higher.
She thought of the horrors in the packing houses at Chicago
recently made the subject of a sensational government
report&mdash;putrid, pestiferous meats put up for human food amid
conditions of unspeakable foulness, freely exposed to deadly germs
from the expectorations of work people suffering from
tuberculosis, in unsanitary rotten buildings soaked through with
blood and every conceivable form of filth and decay, the beef
barons careless and indifferent to the dictates of common decency
so long as they could make more money. And while our public gasped
in disgust at the sickening revelations of the Beef scandal and
foreign countries quickly cancelled their contracts for American
prepared meats, the millionaire packer, insolent in the possession
of wealth stolen from a poisoned public, impudently appeared in
public in his fashionable touring car, with head erect and
self-satisfied, wholly indifferent to his shame.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page236" id="page236" title="236"></a>
<p>These and other evidences of the plutocracy's cruel grip upon
the nation had ended by exasperating the people. There must be a
limit somewhere to the turpitudes of a degenerate class of
<i>nouveaux riches</i>. The day of reckoning was fast approaching
for the grafters and among the first to taste the vengeance of the
people would be the Colossus. But while waiting for the people to
rise in their righteous wrath, Ryder was all powerful, and if it
were true that he had instituted these impeachment proceedings her
father had little chance. What could be done? They could not sit
and wait, as Stott had said, for the action of the Senate. If it
were true that Ryder controlled the Senate as he controlled
everything else her father was doomed. No, they must find some
other way.</p>

<p>And long after the judge and Stott had left for the city
Shirley sat alone on the porch engrossed in thought, taxing her
brain to find some way out of the darkness. And when presently her
mother and aunt returned they found her still sitting there,
silent and preoccupied. If they only had those two letters, she
thought. They alone might save her father. But how could they be
got at? Mr. Ryder had put them safely away, no doubt. He would not
give them up. She wondered how it would be to go boldly to him
appeal to whatever sense of honour and fairness that
<a class="pagebreak" name="page237" id="page237" title="237"></a>
might be lying latent within him. No, such a man would not know
what the terms &ldquo;honour,&rdquo; &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; meant.
She pondered upon it all day and at night when she went tired to
bed it was her last thought as she dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>The following morning broke clear and fine. It was one of those
glorious, ideal days of which we get perhaps half a dozen during
the whole summer, days when the air is cool and bracing,
champagne-like in its exhilarating effect, and when Nature dons
her brightest dress, when the atmosphere is purer, the grass
greener, the sky bluer, the flowers sweeter and the birds sing in
more joyous chorus, when all creation seems in tune. Days that
make living worth while, when one can forget the ugliness, the
selfishness, the empty glitter of the man-made city and walk erect
and buoyant in the open country as in the garden of God.</p>

<p>Shirley went out for a long walk. She preferred to go alone so
she would not have to talk. Hers was one of those lonely,
introspective natures that resent the intrusion of aimless chatter
when preoccupied with serious thoughts. Long Island was unknown
territory to her and it all looked very flat and uninteresting,
but she loved the country and found keen delight in the fresh,
pure air and the sweet scent of new mown hay wafted from the
surrounding fields. In her soft, loose-fitting
<a class="pagebreak" name="page238" id="page238" title="238"></a>
linen dress, her white canvas shoes, garden hat trimmed with red
roses, and lace parasol, she made an attractive picture and every
passer-by&mdash;with the exception of one old farmer and he was
half blind&mdash;turned to look at this good-looking girl, a
stranger in those parts and whose stylish appearance suggested
Fifth Avenue rather than the commonplace purlieus of
Massapequa.</p>

<p>Every now and then Shirley espied in the distance the figure of
a man which she thought she recognized as that of Jefferson. Had
he come, after all? The blood went coursing tumultuously through
her veins only a moment later to leave her face a shade paler as
the man came nearer and she saw he was a stranger. She wondered
what he was doing, if he gave her a thought, if he had spoken to
his father and what the latter had said. She could realize now
what Mr. Ryder's reply had been. Then she wondered what her
future life would be. She could do nothing, of course, until the
Senate had passed upon her father's case, but it was imperative
that she get to work. In a day or two, she would call on her
publishers and learn how her book was selling. She might get other
commissions. If she could not make enough money in literary work
she would have to teach. It was a dreary outlook at best, and she
sighed as she thought of the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page239" id="page239" title="239"></a>
ambitions that had once stirred her breast. All the brightness
seemed to have gone out of her life, her father disgraced,
Jefferson now practically lost to her&mdash;only her work
remained.</p>

<p>As she neared the cottage on her return home she caught sight
of the letter carrier approaching the gate. Instantly she thought
of Jefferson, and she hurried to intercept the man. Perhaps he had
written instead of coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Shirley Rossmore?&rdquo; said the man eyeing her
interrogatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's I,&rdquo; said Shirley.</p>

<p>The postman handed her a letter and passed on. Shirley glanced
quickly at the superscription. No, it was not from Jefferson; she
knew his handwriting too well. The envelope, moreover, bore the
firm name of her publishers. She tore it open and found that it
merely contained another letter which the publishers had
forwarded. This was addressed to Miss Shirley Green and ran as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>Dear Madam.</i>&mdash;If convenient, I should like
to see you at my office, No. 36 Broadway, in relation to your book
&ldquo;The American Octopus.&rdquo; Kindly inform me as to the day
and hour at which I may expect you.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="closing">Yours truly,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="signature">
<span class="sc">John Burkett Ryder,</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="right">per B.</blockquote>

<p>Shirley almost shouted from sheer excitement. At
<a class="pagebreak" name="page240" id="page240" title="240"></a>
first she was alarmed&mdash;the name John Burkett Ryder was such a
bogey to frighten bad children with, she thought he might want to
punish her for writing about him as she had. She hurried to the
porch and sat there reading the letter over and over and her brain
began to evolve ideas. She had been wondering how she could get at
Mr. Ryder and here he was actually asking her to call on him.
Evidently he had not the slightest idea of her identity, for he
had been able to reach her only through her publishers and no
doubt he had exhausted every other means of discovering her
address. The more she pondered over it the more she began to see
in this invitation a way of helping her father. Yes, she would go
and beard the lion in his den, but she would not go to his office.
She would accept the invitation only on condition that the
interview took place in the Ryder mansion where undoubtedly the
letters would be found. She decided to act immediately. No time
was to be lost, so she procured a sheet of paper and an envelope
and wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="sc">Mr. John Burkett Ryder,</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Dear Sir.</i>&mdash;I do not call upon gentlemen at
their business office.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="closing">Yours, etc.,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="signature">
<span class="sc">Shirley Green.</span></blockquote>

<p>Her letter was abrupt and at first glance seemed hardly
calculated to bring about what she wanted&mdash;an
<a class="pagebreak" name="page241" id="page241" title="241"></a>
invitation to call at the Ryder home, but she was shrewd enough to
see that if Ryder wrote to her at all it was because he was most
anxious to see her and her abruptness would not deter him from
trying again. On the contrary, the very unusualness of anyone
thus dictating to him would make him more than ever desirous of
making her acquaintance. So Shirley mailed the letter and awaited
with confidence for Ryder's reply. So certain was she that one
would come that she at once began to form her plan of action. She
would leave Massapequa at once, and her whereabouts must remain a
secret even from her own family. As she intended to go to the
Ryder house in the assumed character of Shirley Green, it would
never do to run the risk of being followed home by a Ryder
detective to the Rossmore cottage. She would confide in one person
only&mdash;Judge Stott. He would know where she was and would be
in constant communication with her. But, otherwise, she must be
alone to conduct the campaign as she judged fit. She would go at
once to New York and take rooms in a boarding house where she
would be known as Shirley Green. As for funds to meet her
expenses, she had her diamonds, and would they not be filling a
more useful purpose if sold to defray the cost of saving her
father than in mere personal adornment? So that evening, while her
<a class="pagebreak" name="page242" id="page242" title="242"></a>
mother was talking with the judge, she beckoned Stott over to the
corner where she was sitting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judge Stott,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I have a
plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled indulgently at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another friend like that of yesterday?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;listen. I am in
earnest now and I want you to help me. You said that no one on
earth could resist John Burkett Ryder, that no one could fight
against the Money Power. Well, do you know what I am going to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a quiver in her voice and her nostrils were dilated
like those of a thoroughbred eager to run the race. She had risen
from her seat and stood facing him, her fists clenched, her face
set and determined. Stott had never seen her in this mood and he
gazed at her half admiringly, half curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; he asked with a slightly
ironical inflection in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to fight John Burkett Ryder!&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>Stott looked at her open-mouthed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I,&rdquo; said Shirley. &ldquo;I'm going to him and
I intend to get those letters if he has them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stott shook his head.</p>

<a name="photo3" id="photo3"></a>
<blockquote class="illustration"><a href="images/photo3.jpg">

<blockquote class="central">&ldquo;How do you classify
him?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;As the greatest criminal the world has
ever produced.&rdquo;&mdash;Act III.</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what are you talking
<a class="pagebreak" name="page243" id="page243" title="243"></a>
about? How can you expect to reach Ryder? We couldn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know just how yet,&rdquo; replied Shirley,
&ldquo;but I'm going to try. I love my father and I'm going to
leave nothing untried to save him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what can you do?&rdquo; persisted Stott. &ldquo;The
matter has been sifted over and over by some of the greatest minds
in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has any woman sifted it over?&rdquo; demanded
Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Stott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it's about time one did,&rdquo; said the girl
decisively. &ldquo;Those letters my father speaks of&mdash;they
would be useful, would they not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would be invaluable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'll get them. If not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don't understand how you're going to get at
Ryder,&rdquo; interrupted Stott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is how,&rdquo; replied Shirley, passing over to him
the letter she had received that afternoon.</p>

<p>As Stott recognized the well-known signature and read the
contents the expression of his face changed. He gasped for breath
and sank into a chair from sheer astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that's different!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that's
different!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Briefly Shirley outlined her plan, explaining that
<a class="pagebreak" name="page244" id="page244" title="244"></a>
she would go to live in the city immediately and conduct her
campaign from there. If she was successful it might save her
father and if not no harm could come of it.</p>

<p>Stott demurred at first. He did not wish to bear alone the
responsibility of such an adventure. There was no knowing what
might happen to her, visiting a strange house under an assumed
name. But when he saw how thoroughly in earnest she was and that
she was ready to proceed without him he capitulated. He agreed
that she might be able to find the missing letters or if not that
she might make some impression on Ryder himself. She could show
interest in the judge's case as a disinterested outsider and so
might win his sympathies. From being a sceptic, Stott now became
enthusiastic. He promised to co-operate in every way and to keep
Shirley's whereabouts an absolute secret. The girl, therefore,
began to make her preparations for departure from home by telling
her parents that she had accepted an invitation to spend a week or
two with an old college chum in New York.</p>

<p>That same evening her mother, the judge, and Stott went for a
stroll after dinner and left her to take care of the house. They
had wanted Shirley to go, too, but she pleaded fatigue. The truth
was that she wanted to be alone so she could ponder undisturbed
<a class="pagebreak" name="page245" id="page245" title="245"></a>
over her plans. It was a clear, starlit night, with no moon, and
Shirley sat on the porch listening to the chirping of the crickets
and idly watching the flashes of the mysterious fireflies. She was
in no mood for reading and sat for a long time rocking herself
engrossed in her thoughts. Suddenly she heard someone unfasten the
garden gate. It was too soon for the return of the promenaders; it
must be a visitor. Through the uncertain penumbra of the garden
she discerned approaching a form which looked familiar. Yes, now
there was no doubt possible. It was, indeed, Jefferson Ryder.</p>

<p>She hurried down the porch to greet him. No matter what the
father had done she could never think any the less of the son. He
took her hand and for several moments neither one spoke. There are
times when silence is more eloquent than speech and this was one
of them. The gentle grip of his big strong hand expressed more
tenderly than any words the sympathy that lay in his heart for the
woman he loved. Shirley said quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come at last, Jefferson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came as soon as I could,&rdquo; he replied gently.
&ldquo;I saw father only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not tell me what he said,&rdquo; Shirley
hastened to say.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page246" id="page246" title="246"></a>
<p>Jefferson made no reply. He understood what she meant. He hung
his head and hit viciously with his walking stick at the pebbles
that lay at his feet. She went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know everything now. It was foolish of me to think
that Mr. Ryder would ever help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't help it in any way,&rdquo; blurted out
Jefferson. &ldquo;I have not the slightest influence over him.
His business methods I consider disgraceful&mdash;you understand
that, don't you, Shirley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl laid her hand on his arm and replied kindly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Jeff, we know that. Come up and sit
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He followed her on the porch and drew up a rocker beside
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all out for a walk,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm glad,&rdquo; he said frankly. &ldquo;I wanted a
quiet talk with you. I did not care to meet anyone. My name must
be odious to your people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both were silent, feeling a certain awkwardness. They seemed
to have drifted apart in some way since those delightful days in
Paris and on the ship. Then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going away, but I couldn't go until I saw
you.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page247" id="page247" title="247"></a>
<p>&ldquo;You are going away?&rdquo; exclaimed Shirley,
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot stand it any more
at home. I had a hot talk with my father yesterday about one thing
and another. He and I don't chin well together. Besides this
matter of your father's impeachment has completely discouraged me.
All the wealth in the world could never reconcile me to such
methods! I'm ashamed of the rôle my own flesh and blood has
played in that miserable affair. I can't express what I feel about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed Shirley, &ldquo;it is hard to believe
that you are the son of that man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is your father?&rdquo; inquired Jefferson.
&ldquo;How does he take it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, his heart beats and he can see and hear and
speak,&rdquo; replied Shirley sadly, &ldquo;but he is only a
shadow of what he once was. If the trial goes against him, I don't
think he'll survive it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is monstrous,&rdquo; cried Jefferson. &ldquo;To think
that my father should be responsible for this thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are still hoping for the best,&rdquo; added Shirley,
&ldquo;but the outlook is dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;These surroundings are not for you&mdash;&rdquo; He looked
around
<a class="pagebreak" name="page248" id="page248" title="248"></a>
at the cheap furnishings which he could see through the open
window and his face showed real concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall teach or write, or go out as governess,&rdquo;
replied Shirley with a tinge of bitterness. Then smiling sadly she
added: &ldquo;Poverty is easy; it is unmerited disgrace which is
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man drew his chair closer and took hold of the hand
that lay in her lap. She made no resistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shirley,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you remember that
talk we had on the ship? I asked you to be my wife. You led me to
believe that you were not indifferent to me. I ask you again to
marry me. Give me the right to take care of you and yours. I am
the son of the world's richest man, but I don't want his money. I
have earned a competence of my own&mdash;enough to live on
comfortably. We will go away where you and your father and mother
will make their home with us. Do not let the sins of the fathers
embitter the lives of the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine has not sinned,&rdquo; said Shirley bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could say the same of mine,&rdquo; replied
Jefferson. &ldquo;It is because the clouds are dark about you
that I want to come into your life to comfort you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jefferson, the circumstances make such a marriage
<a class="pagebreak" name="page249" id="page249" title="249"></a>
impossible. Your family and everybody else would say that I had
inveigled you into it. It is even more impossible now than I
thought it was when I spoke to you on the ship. Then I was worried
about my father's trouble and could give no thought to anything
else. Now it is different. Your father's action has made our union
impossible for ever. I thank you for the honour you have done me.
I do like you. I like you well enough to be your wife, but I will
not accept this sacrifice on your part. Your offer, coming at such
a critical time, is dictated only by your noble, generous nature,
by your sympathy for our misfortune. Afterwards, you might regret
it. If my father were convicted and driven from the bench and you
found you had married the daughter of a disgraced man you would be
ashamed of us all, and if I saw that it would break my
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emotion stopped her utterance and she buried her face in her
hands weeping silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shirley,&rdquo; said Jefferson gently, &ldquo;you are
wrong. I love you for yourself, not because of your trouble. You
know that. I shall never love any other woman but you. If you will
not say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; now, I shall go away as I told my father
I would and one day I shall come back and then if you are still
single I shall ask you again to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page250" id="page250" title="250"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall travel for a year and then, may be, I shall stay
a couple of years in Paris, studying at the Beaux Arts. Then I may
go to Rome. If I am to do anything worth while in the career I
have chosen I must have that European training.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paris! Rome!&rdquo; echoed Shirley. &ldquo;How I envy
you! Yes, you are right. Get away from this country where the only
topic, the only thought is money, where the only incentive to work
is dollars. Go where there are still some ideals, where you can
breathe the atmosphere of culture and art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forgetting momentarily her own troubles, Shirley chatted on
about life in the art centres of Europe, advised Jefferson where
to go, with whom to study. She knew people in Paris, Rome and
Munich and she would give him letters to them. Only, if he wanted
to perfect himself in the languages, he ought to avoid Americans
and cultivate the natives. Then, who could tell? if he worked hard
and was lucky, he might have something exhibited at the Salon and
return to America a famous painter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; smiled Jefferson, &ldquo;you shall be
the first to congratulate me. I shall come and ask you to be my
wife. May I?&rdquo; he added,</p>

<p>Shirley smiled gravely.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page251" id="page251" title="251"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Get famous first. You may not want me then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall always want you,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely,
bending over her. In the dim light of the porch he saw that her
tear-stained face was drawn and pale. He rose and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Jefferson.&rdquo; She rose and put her hand in
his. &ldquo;We shall always be friends. I, too, am going
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You going away&mdash;where to?&rdquo; he asked
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have work to do in connection with my father's
case,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; said Jefferson puzzled. &ldquo;You have work
to do&mdash;what work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't say what it is, Jefferson. There are good
reasons why I can't. You must take my word for it that it is
urgent and important work.&rdquo; Then she added: &ldquo;You go
your way, Jefferson; I will go mine. It was not our destiny to
belong to each other. You will become famous as an artist. And
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo; echoed Jefferson.</p>

<a name="typo3" id="typo3"></a>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I shall devote my life to my father. It's no
use, Jefferson&mdash;really&mdash;I've thought it all out. You
must not come back to me&mdash;you understand. We must be alone
with our grief&mdash;father and I. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page252" id="page252" title="252"></a>
<p>He raised her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Shirley. Don't forget me. I shall come back
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went down the porch and she watched him go out of the gate
and down the road until she could see his figure no longer. Then
she turned back and sank into her chair and burying her face in
her handkerchief she gave way to a torrent of tears which afforded
some relief to the weight on her heart. Presently the others
returned from their walk and she told them about the visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ryder's son, Jefferson, was here. We crossed on the
same ship. I introduced him to Judge Stott on the dock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge looked surprised, but he merely said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope for his sake that he is a different man from his
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; replied Shirley simply, and nothing more
was said.</p>

<p>Two days went by, during which Shirley went on completing the
preparations for her visit to New York. It was arranged that
Stott should escort her to the city. Shortly before they started
for the train a letter arrived for Shirley. Like the first one it
had been forwarded by her publishers. It read as follows:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page253" id="page253" title="253"></a>
<blockquote><span class="sc">Miss Shirley Green,</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Dear Madam.</i>&mdash;I shall be happy to see you
at my residence&mdash;Fifth Avenue&mdash;any afternoon that you
will mention.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="closing">Yours very truly,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="signature">
<span class="sc">John Burkett Ryder,</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="right">per B.</blockquote>

<p>Shirley smiled in triumph as, unseen by her father and mother,
she passed it over to Stott. She at once sat down and wrote this
reply:</p>

<blockquote><span class="sc">Mr. John Burkett Ryder,</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Dear Sir.</i>&mdash;I am sorry that I am unable to
comply with your request. I prefer the invitation to call at your
private residence should come from Mrs. Ryder.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="closing">Yours, etc.,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="signature">
<span class="sc">Shirley Green.</span></blockquote>

<p>She laughed as she showed this to Stott:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll write me again,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and next
time his wife will sign the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour later she left Massapequa for the city.</p>

<a name="chapter11" id="chapter11"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>The Hon. Fitzroy Bagley had every reason to feel satisfied with
himself. His <i>affaire de c&oelig;ur</i> with the Senator's
daughter was progressing more smoothly than ever, and nothing now
seemed likely to interfere with his carefully prepared plans to
capture an American heiress. The interview with Kate Roberts in
the library, so awkwardly disturbed by Jefferson's unexpected
intrusion, had been followed by other interviews more secret and
more successful, and the plausible secretary had contrived so well
to persuade the girl that he really thought the world of her, and
that a brilliant future awaited her as his wife, that it was not
long before he found her in a mood to refuse him nothing.</p>

<p>Bagley urged immediate marriage; he insinuated that Jefferson
had treated her shamefully and that she owed it to herself to show
the world that there were other men as good as the one who had
jilted her. He argued that in view of the Senator being bent on
the match with Ryder's son it would be worse than useless for him,
Bagley, to make formal application
<a class="pagebreak" name="page255" id="page255" title="255"></a>
for her hand, so, as he explained, the only thing which remained
was a runaway marriage. Confronted with the <i>fait accompli</i>,
papa Roberts would bow to the inevitable. They could get married
quietly in town, go away for a short trip, and when the Senator
had gotten over his first disappointment they would be welcomed
back with open arms.</p>

<p>Kate listened willingly enough to this specious reasoning. In
her heart she was piqued at Jefferson's indifference and she was
foolish enough to really believe that this marriage with a British
nobleman, twice removed, would be in the nature of a triumph over
him. Besides, this project of an elopement appealed strangely to
her frivolous imagination; it put her in the same class as all her
favourite novel heroines. And it would be capital fun!</p>

<p>Meantime, Senator Roberts, in blissful ignorance of this little
plot against his domestic peace, was growing impatient and he
approached his friend Ryder once more on the subject of his son
Jefferson. The young man, he said, had been back from Europe some
time. He insisted on knowing what his attitude was towards his
daughter. If they were engaged to be married he said there should
be a public announcement of the fact. It was unfair to him and a
slight to his daughter to let matters hang fire in this
unsatisfactory way and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page256" id="page256" title="256"></a>
he hinted that both himself and his daughter might demand their
passports from the Ryder mansion unless some explanation were
forthcoming.</p>

<p>Ryder was in a quandary. He had no wish to quarrel with his
useful Washington ally; he recognized the reasonableness of his
complaint. Yet what could he do? Much as he himself desired the
marriage, his son was obstinate and showed little inclination to
settle down. He even hinted at attractions in another quarter. He
did not tell the Senator of his recent interview with his son when
the latter made it very plain that the marriage could never take
place. Ryder, Sr., had his own reasons for wishing to temporize.
It was quite possible that Jefferson might change his mind and
abandon his idea of going abroad and he suggested to the Senator
that perhaps if he, the Senator, made the engagement public
through the newspapers it might have the salutary effect of
forcing his son's hand.</p>

<p>So a few mornings later there appeared among the society notes
in several of the New York papers this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote> &ldquo;The engagement is announced of Miss Katherine
Roberts, only daughter of senator Roberts of Wisconsin, to
Jefferson Ryder, son of Mr. John Burkett
Ryder.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>Two persons in New York happened to see the item about the same
time and both were equally interested,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page257" id="page257" title="257"></a>
although it affected them in a different manner. One was Shirley
Rossmore, who had chanced to pick up the newspaper at the
breakfast table in her boarding house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So soon?&rdquo; she murmured to herself. Well, why not?
She could not blame Jefferson. He had often spoken to her of this
match arranged by his father and they had laughed over it as a
typical marriage of convenience modelled after the Continental
pattern. Jefferson, she knew, had never cared for the girl nor
taken the affair seriously. Some powerful influences must have
been at work to make him surrender so easily. Here again she
recognized the masterly hand of Ryder, Sr., and more than ever she
was eager to meet this extraordinary man and measure her strength
with his. Her mind, indeed, was too full of her father's troubles
to grieve over her own however much she might have been inclined
to do so under other circumstances, and all that day she did her
best to banish the paragraph from her thoughts. More than a week
had passed since she left Massapequa and what with corresponding
with financiers, calling on editors and publishers, every moment
of her time had been kept busy. She had found a quiet and
reasonable priced boarding house off Washington Square and here
Stott had called several times to see her. Her correspondence with
<a class="pagebreak" name="page258" id="page258" title="258"></a>
Mr. Ryder had now reached a phase when it was impossible to invent
any further excuses for delaying the interview asked for. As she
had foreseen, a day or two after her arrival in town she had
received a note from Mrs. Ryder asking her to do her the honour to
call and see her, and Shirley, after waiting another two days, had
replied making an appointment for the following day at three
o'clock. This was the same day on which the paragraph concerning
the Ryder-Roberts engagement appeared in the society chronicles of
the metropolis.</p>

<p>Directly after the meagre meal which in New York boarding
houses is dignified by the name of luncheon, Shirley proceeded to
get ready for this portentous visit to the Ryder mansion. She was
anxious to make a favourable impression on the financier, so she
took some pains with her personal appearance. She always looked
stylish, no matter what she wore, and her poverty was of too
recent date to make much difference to her wardrobe, which was
still well supplied with Paris-made gowns. She selected a simple
close-fitting gown of gray chiffon cloth and a picture hat of
Leghorn straw heaped with red roses, Shirley's favourite flower.
Thus arrayed, she sallied forth at two o'clock&mdash;a little gray
mouse to do battle with the formidable lion.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page259" id="page259" title="259"></a>
<p>The sky was threatening, so instead of walking a short way up
Fifth Avenue for exercise, as she had intended doing, she cut
across town through Ninth Street, and took the surface car on
Fourth Avenue. This would put her down at Madison Avenue and
Seventy-fourth Street, which was only a block from the Ryder
residence. She looked so pretty and was so well dressed that the
passers-by who looked after her wondered why she did not take a
cab instead of standing on a street corner for a car. But one's
outward appearance is not always a faithful index to the condition
of one's pocketbook, and Shirley was rapidly acquiring the art of
economy.</p>

<p>It was not without a certain trepidation that she began this
journey. So far, all her plans had been based largely on theory,
but now that she was actually on her way to Mr. Ryder all sorts of
misgivings beset her. Suppose he knew her by sight and roughly
accused her of obtaining access to his house under false pretences
and then had her ejected by the servants? How terrible and
humiliating that would be! And even if he did not how could she
possibly find those letters with him watching her, and all in the
brief time of a conventional afternoon call? It had been an absurd
idea from the first. Stott was right; she saw that now. But she
had entered upon it and she was not going to
<a class="pagebreak" name="page260" id="page260" title="260"></a>
confess herself beaten until she had tried. And as the car sped
along Madison Avenue, gradually drawing nearer to the house which
she was going to enter disguised as it were, like a burglar, she
felt cold chills run up and down her spine&mdash;the same
sensation that one experiences when one rings the bell of a
dentist's where one has gone to have a tooth extracted. In fact,
she felt so nervous and frightened that if she had not been
ashamed before herself she would have turned back. In about twenty
minutes the car stopped at the corner of Seventy-fourth Street.
Shirley descended and with a quickened pulse walked towards the
Ryder mansion, which she knew well by sight.</p>

<br />

<p>There was one other person in New York who, that same morning,
had read the newspaper item regarding the Ryder-Roberts betrothal,
and he did not take the matter so calmly as Shirley had done. On
the contrary, it had the effect of putting him into a violent
rage. This was Jefferson. He was working in his studio when he
read it and five minutes later he was tearing up-town to seek the
author of it. He understood its object, of course; they wanted to
force his hand, to shame him into this marriage, to so entangle
him with the girl that no other alternative would be possible to
an honourable man. It was a despicable
<a class="pagebreak" name="page261" id="page261" title="261"></a>
trick and he had no doubt that his father was at the back of it.
So his mind now was fully made up. He would go away at once where
they could not make his life a burden with this odious marriage
which was fast becoming a nightmare to him. He would close up his
studio and leave immediately for Europe. He would show his father
once for all that he was a man and expected to be treated as
one.</p>

<p>He wondered what Shirley was doing. Where had she gone, what
was this mysterious work of which she had spoken? He only realized
now, when she seemed entirely beyond his reach, how much he loved
her and how empty his life would be without her. He would know no
happiness until she was his wife. Her words on the porch did not
discourage him. Under the circumstances he could not expect her to
have said anything else. She could not marry into John Ryder's
family with such a charge hanging over her own father's head, but,
later, when the trial was over, no matter how it turned out, he
would go to her again and ask her to be his wife.</p>

<p>On arriving home the first person he saw was the ubiquitous Mr.
Bagley, who stood at the top of the first staircase giving some
letters to the butler. Jefferson cornered him at once, holding out
the newspaper containing the offending paragraph.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page262" id="page262" title="262"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Bagley,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what does this
mean? Is this any of your doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The English secretary gave his employer's son a haughty stare,
and then, without deigning to reply or even to glance at the
newspaper, continued his instructions to the servant:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Jorkins, get stamps for all these letters and see
they are mailed at once. They are very important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man took the letters and disappeared, while Jefferson,
impatient, repeated his question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My doing?&rdquo; sneered Mr. Bagley. &ldquo;Really,
Jefferson, you go too far! Do you suppose for one instant that I
would condescend to trouble myself with your affairs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson was in no mood to put up with insolence from anyone,
especially from a man whom he heartily despised, so advancing
menacingly he thundered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;were you, in the discharge of your
menial-like duties, instructed by my father to send that paragraph
to the newspapers regarding my alleged betrothal to Miss Roberts?
Yes or No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man winced and made a step backward. There was a gleam in
the Ryder eye which he knew by experience boded no good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Jefferson,&rdquo; he said in a more conciliatory
<a class="pagebreak" name="page263" id="page263" title="263"></a>
tone, &ldquo;I know absolutely nothing about the paragraph. This
is the first I hear of it. Why not ask your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Jefferson grimly.</p>

<p>He was turning to go in the direction of the library when
Bagley stopped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot possibly see him now,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Sergeant Ellison of the Secret Service is in there with
him, and your father told me not to disturb him on any account. He
has another appointment at three o'clock with some woman who
writes books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing that the fellow was in earnest, Jefferson did not
insist. He could see his father a little later or send him a
message through his mother. Proceeding upstairs he found Mrs.
Ryder in her room and in a few energetic words he explained the
situation to his mother. They had gone too far with this
match-making business, he said, his father was trying to interfere
with his personal liberty and he was going to put a stop to it. He
would leave at once for Europe. Mrs. Ryder had already heard of
the projected trip abroad, so the news of this sudden departure
was not the shock it might otherwise have been. In her heart she
did not blame her son, on the contrary she admired his spirit, and
if the temporary absence from home would make him happier, she
would not hold him
<a class="pagebreak" name="page264" id="page264" title="264"></a>
back. Yet, mother like, she wept and coaxed, but nothing would
shake Jefferson in his determination and he begged his mother to
make it very plain to his father that this was final and that a
few days would see him on his way abroad. He would try and come
back to see his father that afternoon, but otherwise she was to
say good-bye for him. Mrs. Ryder promised tearfully to do what her
son demanded and a few minutes later Jefferson was on his way to
the front door.</p>

<p>As he went down stairs something white on the carpet attracted
his attention. He stooped and picked it up. It was a letter. It
was in Bagley's handwriting and had evidently been dropped by the
man to whom the secretary had given it to post. But what
interested Jefferson more than anything else was that it was
addressed to Miss Kate Roberts. Under ordinary circumstances, a
king's ransom would not have tempted the young man to read a
letter addressed to another, but he was convinced that his
father's secretary was an adventurer and if he were carrying on an
intrigue in this manner it could have only one meaning. It was his
duty to unveil a rascal who was using the Ryder roof and name to
further his own ends and victimize a girl who, although
sophisticated enough to know better, was too silly to realize the
risk she ran at
<a class="pagebreak" name="page265" id="page265" title="265"></a>
the hands of an unscrupulous man. Hesitating no longer, Jefferson
tore open the envelope and read:</p>

<blockquote>My dearest wife that is to be:</blockquote>
<blockquote>I have arranged everything. Next Wednesday&mdash;just
a week from to-day&mdash;we will go to the house of a discreet
friend of mine where a minister will marry us; then we will go to
City Hall and get through the legal part of it. Afterwards, we can
catch the four o'clock train for Buffalo. Meet me in the ladies'
room at the Holland House Wednesday morning at 11 a.m. I will come
there with a closed cab.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="closing">Your devoted</blockquote>
<blockquote class="signature"><span class="sc">Fitz.</span></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; Jefferson whistled. A close shave this for
Senator Roberts, he thought. His first impulse was to go upstairs
again to his mother and put the matter in her hands. She would
immediately inform his father, who would make short work of Mr.
Bagley. But, thought Jefferson, why should he spoil a good thing?
He could afford to wait a day or two. There was no hurry. He could
allow Bagley to think all was going swimmingly and then uncover
the plot at the eleventh hour. He would even let this letter go to
Kate, there was no difficulty in procuring another envelope and
imitating the handwriting&mdash;and when Bagley was just preparing
to go to the rendezvous he would spring the trap. Such a cad
deserved no mercy. The scandal would be a knock-out blow, his
father would discharge him on the spot and that would be the last
they would
<a class="pagebreak" name="page266" id="page266" title="266"></a>
see of the aristocratic English secretary. Jefferson put the
letter in his pocket and left the house rejoicing.</p>

<br />

<p>While the foregoing incidents were happening John Burkett Ryder
was secluded in his library. The great man had come home earlier
than usual, for he had two important callers to see by appointment
that afternoon. One was Sergeant Ellison, who had to report on
his mission to Massapequa; the other was Miss Shirley Green, the
author of &ldquo;The American Octopus,&rdquo; who had at last
deigned to honour him with a visit. Pending the arrival of these
visitors the financier was busy with his secretary trying to get
rid as rapidly as possible of what business and correspondence
there was on hand.</p>

<p>The plutocrat was sitting at his desk poring over a mass of
papers. Between his teeth was the inevitable long black cigar and
when he raised his eyes to the light a close observer might have
remarked that they were sea-green, a colour they assumed when the
man of millions was absorbed in scheming new business deals. Every
now and then he stopped reading the papers to make quick
calculations on scraps of paper. Then if the result pleased him,
a smile overspread his saturnine features. He rose from his chair
and nervously paced the floor as he always did when thinking
deeply.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page267" id="page267" title="267"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Five millions,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;not a cent
more. If they won't sell we'll crush them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley entered. Mr. Ryder looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Bagley?&rdquo; he said interrogatively. &ldquo;Has
Sergeant Ellison come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. But Mr. Herts is downstairs. He insists on
seeing you about the Philadelphia gas deal. He says it is a matter
of life and death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To him&mdash;yes,&rdquo; answered the financier dryly.
&ldquo;Let him come up. We might as well have it out
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley went out and returned almost immediately, followed
by a short, fat man, rather loudly dressed and apoplectic in
appearance. He looked like a prosperous brewer, while, as a matter
of fact, he was president of a gas company, one of the shrewdest
promoters in the country, and a big man in Wall Street. There was
only one bigger man and that was John Ryder. But, to-day, Mr.
Herts was not in good condition. His face was pale and his manner
flustered and nervous. He was plainly worried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ryder,&rdquo; he began with excited gesture,
&ldquo;the terms you offer are preposterous. It would mean
disaster to the stockholders. Our gas properties are worth six
times that amount. We will sell out for twenty millions&mdash;not
a cent less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page268" id="page268" title="268"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Herts,&rdquo; he replied coolly, &ldquo;I am busy
to-day and in no mood for arguing. We'll either buy you out or
force you out. Choose. You have our offer. Five millions for your
gas property. Will you take it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll see you in hell first!&rdquo; cried his visitor
exasperated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Ryder still unruffled,
&ldquo;all negotiations are off. You leave me free to act. We have
an offer to buy cheap the old Germantown Gas Company which has
charter rights to go into any of the streets of Philadelphia. We
shall purchase that company, we will put ten millions new capital
into it, and reduce the price of gas in Philadelphia to sixty
cents a thousand. Where will you be then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The face of the Colossus as he uttered this stand and deliver
speech was calm and inscrutable. Conscious of the resistless power
of his untold millions, he felt no more compunction in mercilessly
crushing this business rival than he would in trampling out the
life of a worm. The little man facing him looked haggard and
distressed. He knew well that this was no idle threat. He was well
aware that Ryder and his associates by the sheer weight of the
enormous wealth they controlled could sell out or destroy any
industrial corporation in the land. It was plainly illegal, but it
was done every day, and his company was not the first
<a class="pagebreak" name="page269" id="page269" title="269"></a>
victim nor the last. Desperate, he appealed humbly to the
tyrannical Money Power:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't drive us to the wall, Mr. Ryder. This forced sale
will mean disaster to us all. Put yourself in our
place&mdash;think what it means to scores of families whose only
support is the income from their investment in our
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Herts,&rdquo; replied Ryder unmoved, &ldquo;I never
allow sentiment to interfere with business. You have heard my
terms. I refuse to argue the matter further. What is it to be?
Five millions or competition? Decide now or this interview must
end!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took out his watch and with his other hand touched a bell.
Beads of perspiration stood on his visitor's forehead. In a voice
broken with suppressed emotion he said hoarsely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're a hard, pitiless man, John Ryder! So be
it&mdash;five millions. I don't know what they'll say. I don't
dare return to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are my terms,&rdquo; said Ryder coldly. &ldquo;The
papers,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;will be ready for your signature
to-morrow at this time, and I'll have a cheque ready for the
entire amount. Good-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley entered. Ryder bowed to Herts, who slowly retired.
When the door had closed on him
<a class="pagebreak" name="page270" id="page270" title="270"></a>
Ryder went back to his desk, a smile of triumph on his face. Then
he turned to his secretary:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let Sergeant Ellison come up,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The secretary left the room and Mr. Ryder sank comfortably in
his chair, puffing silently at his long black cigar. The financier
was thinking, but his thoughts concerned neither the luckless gas
president he had just pitilessly crushed, nor the detective who
had come to make his report. He was thinking of the book
&ldquo;The American Octopus,&rdquo; and its bold author whom he
was to meet in a very few minutes. He glanced at the clock. A
quarter to three. She would be here in fifteen minutes if she were
punctual, but women seldom are, he reflected. What kind of a woman
could she be, this Shirley Green, to dare cross swords with a man
whose power was felt in two hemispheres? No ordinary woman, that
was certain. He tried to imagine what she looked like, and he
pictured a tall, gaunt, sexless spinster with spectacles, a sort
of nightmare in the garb of a woman. A sour, discontented
creature, bitter to all mankind, owing to disappointments in early
life and especially vindictive towards the rich, whom her
socialistic and even anarchistical tendencies prompted her to hate
and attack. Yet, withal, a brainy, intelligent woman, remarkably
well informed as to political and industrial conditions&mdash;a
woman to
<a class="pagebreak" name="page271" id="page271" title="271"></a>
make a friend of rather than an enemy. And John Ryder, who had
educated himself to believe that with gold he could do everything,
that none could resist its power, had no doubt that with money he
could enlist this Shirley Green in his service. At least it would
keep her from writing more books about him.</p>

<p>The door opened and Sergeant Ellison entered, followed by the
secretary, who almost immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sergeant,&rdquo; said Mr. Ryder cordially,
&ldquo;what have you to tell me? I can give you only a few
minutes. I expect a lady friend of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plutocrat sometimes condescended to be jocular with his
subordinates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lady friend of mine, sir?&rdquo; echoed the man,
puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Miss Shirley Green, the author,&rdquo; replied
the financier, enjoying the detective's embarrassment.
&ldquo;That suggestion of yours worked out all right. She's
coming here to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm glad you've found her, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a tough job,&rdquo; answered Ryder with a
grimace. &ldquo;We wrote her half a dozen times before she was
satisfied with the wording of the invitation. But, finally, we
landed her and I expect her at three o'clock.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page272" id="page272" title="272"></a>
Now what about that Rossmore girl? Did you go down to
Massapequa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I have been there half a dozen times. In fact,
I've just come from there. Judge Rossmore is there, all right, but
his daughter has left for parts unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone away&mdash;where?&rdquo; exclaimed the
financier.</p>

<p>This was what he dreaded. As long as he could keep his eye on
the girl there was little danger of Jefferson making a fool of
himself; with her disappeared everything was possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not find out, sir. Their neighbours don't know
much about them. They say they're haughty and stuck up. The only
one I could get anything out of was a parson named Deetle. He said
it was a sad case, that they had reverses and a daughter who was
in Paris&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Ryder impatiently, &ldquo;we know
all that. But where's the daughter now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search me, sir. I even tried to pump the Irish slavey.
Gee, what a vixen! She almost flew at me. She said she didn't
know and didn't care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder brought his fist down with force on his desk, a trick he
had when he wished to emphasize a point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sergeant, I don't like the mysterious disappearance of
that girl. You must find her, do you hear, you must
<a class="pagebreak" name="page273" id="page273" title="273"></a>
find her if it takes all the sleuths in the country. Had my son
been seen there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The parson said he saw a young fellow answering his
description sitting on the porch of the Rossmore cottage the
evening before the girl disappeared, but he didn't know who he was
and hasn't seen him since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was my son, I'll wager. He knows where the girl is.
Perhaps he's with her now. Maybe he's going to marry her. That
must be prevented at any cost. Sergeant, find that Rossmore girl
and I'll give you $1,000.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detective's face flushed with pleasure at the prospect of
so liberal a reward. Rising he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll find her, sir. I'll find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley entered, wearing the solemn, important air he always
affected when he had to announce a visitor of consequence. But
before he could open his mouth Mr. Ryder said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bagley, when did you see my son, Jefferson,
last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day, sir. He wanted to see you to say good-bye. He
said he would be back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder gave a sigh of relief and addressing the detective
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's not so bad as I thought.&rdquo; Then turning again
to his secretary he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Bagley, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page274" id="page274" title="274"></a>
<p>&ldquo;There's a lady downstairs, sir&mdash;Miss Shirley
Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The financier half sprang from his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Show her up at once. Good-bye, sergeant,
good-bye. Find that Rossmore woman and the $1,000 is
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detective went out and a few moments later Mr. Bagley
reappeared ushering in Shirley.</p>

<p>The mouse was in the den of the lion.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page275" id="page275" title="275"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Mr. Ryder remained at his desk and did not even look up when
his visitor entered. He pretended to be busily preoccupied with
his papers, which was a favourite pose of his when receiving
strangers. This frigid reception invariably served its purpose,
for it led visitors not to expect more than they got, which
usually was little enough. For several minutes Shirley stood
still, not knowing whether to advance or to take a seat. She gave
a little conventional cough, and Ryder looked up. What he saw so
astonished him that he at once took from his mouth the cigar he
was smoking and rose from his seat. He had expected a gaunt old
maid with spectacles, and here was a stylish, good-looking young
woman, who could not possibly be over twenty-five. There was
surely some mistake. This slip of a girl could not have written
&ldquo;The American Octopus.&rdquo; He advanced to greet
Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish to see me, Madame?&rdquo; he asked courteously.
There were times when even John Burkett Ryder could be polite.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page276" id="page276" title="276"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Shirley, her voice trembling a
little; in spite of her efforts to keep cool. &ldquo;I am here by
appointment. Three o'clock, Mrs. Ryder's note said. I am Miss
Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>&mdash;Miss Green?&rdquo; echoed the financier
dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am Miss Green&mdash;Shirley Green, author of
&lsquo;The American Octopus.&rsquo; You asked me to call. Here I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, John Ryder was nonplussed. He
coughed and stammered and looked round for a place where he could
throw his cigar. Shirley, who enjoyed his embarrassment, put him
at his ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please go on smoking,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
don't mind it in the least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder threw the cigar into a receptacle and looked closely at
his visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are Shirley Green, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my <i>nom-de-plume</i>&mdash;yes,&rdquo; replied
the girl nervously. She was already wishing herself back at
Massapequa. The financier eyed her for a moment in silence as if
trying to gauge the strength of the personality of this audacious
young woman, who had dared to criticise his business methods in
public print; then, waving her to a seat near his desk, he
said:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page277" id="page277" title="277"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; murmured Shirley. She sat down, and he
took his seat at the other side of the desk, which brought them
face to face. Again inspecting the girl with a close scrutiny that
made her cheeks burn, Ryder said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather expected&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped for a moment
as if uncertain what to say, then he added: &ldquo;You're younger
than I thought you were, Miss Green, much younger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time will remedy that,&rdquo; smiled Shirley. Then,
mischievously, she added: &ldquo;I rather expected to see Mrs.
Ryder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was the faintest suspicion of a smile playing around the
corners of the plutocrat's mouth as he picked up a book lying on
his desk and replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;she wrote you, but I&mdash;wanted to see you
about this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley's pulse throbbed faster, but she tried hard to appear
unconcerned as she answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my book&mdash;have you read it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Ryder slowly and, fixing her with
a stare that was beginning to make her uncomfortable, he went on:
&ldquo;No doubt your time is valuable, so I'll come right to the
point. I want to ask you, Miss Green, where you got the character
of your central
<a class="pagebreak" name="page278" id="page278" title="278"></a>
figure&mdash;the Octopus, as you call him&mdash;John
Broderick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From imagination&mdash;of course,&rdquo; answered
Shirley.</p>

<p>Ryder opened the book, and Shirley noticed that there were
several passages marked. He turned the leaves over in silence for
a minute or two and then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've sketched a pretty big man here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Shirley, &ldquo;he has big
possibilities, but I think he makes very small use of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder appeared not to notice her commentary, and, still reading
the book, he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On page 22 you call him &lsquo;<i>the world's greatest
individualized potentiality, a giant combination of materiality,
mentality and money&mdash;the greatest exemplar of individual
human will in existence to-day.</i>&rsquo; And you make
indomitable will and energy the keystone of his marvellous
success. Am I right?&rdquo; He looked at her questioningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; answered Shirley.</p>

<p>Ryder proceeded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On page 26 you say &lsquo;<i>the machinery of his
money-making mind typifies the laws of perpetual unrest. It must
go on, relentlessly, resistlessly, ruthlessly making
money&mdash;making money and continuing to make money. It cannot
stop until the machinery crumbles.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page279" id="page279" title="279"></a>
<p>Laying the book down and turning sharply on Shirley, he asked
her bluntly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that I couldn't stop to-morrow if I
wanted to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She affected to not understand him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You?</i>&rdquo; she inquired in a tone of
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;it's a natural question,&rdquo; stammered
Ryder, with a nervous little laugh; &ldquo;every man sees himself
in the hero of a novel just as every woman sees herself in the
heroine. We're all heroes and heroines in our own eyes. But tell
me what's your private opinion of this man. You drew the
character. What do you think of him as a type, how would you
classify him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the greatest criminal the world has yet
produced,&rdquo; replied Shirley without a moment's
hesitation.</p>

<p>The financier looked at the girl in unfeigned astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Criminal?&rdquo; he echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, criminal,&rdquo; repeated Shirley decisively.
&ldquo;He is avarice, egotism, and ambition incarnate. He loves
money because he loves power, and he loves power more than his
fellow man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder laughed uneasily. Decidedly, this girl had opinions of
her own which she was not backward to express.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't that rather strong?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page280" id="page280" title="280"></a>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; replied Shirley. Then quickly
she asked: &ldquo;But what does it matter? No such man
exists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; said Ryder, and he relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>Yet while he said nothing, the plutocrat was watching his
visitor closely from under his thick eyebrows. She seemed
supremely unconscious of his scrutiny. Her aristocratic,
thoughtful face gave no sign that any ulterior motive had actuated
her evidently very hostile attitude against him. That he was in
her mind when she drew the character of John Broderick there was
no doubt possible. No matter how she might evade the
identification, he was convinced he was the hero of her book. Why
had she attacked him so bitterly? At first, it occurred to him
that blackmail might be her object; she might be going to ask for
money as the price of future silence. Yet it needed but a glance
at her refined and modest demeanour to dispel that idea as absurd.
Then he remembered, too, that it was not she who had sought this
interview, but himself. No, she was no blackmailer. More probably
she was a dreamer&mdash;one of those meddling sociologists who,
under pretence of bettering the conditions of the working classes,
stir up discontent and bitterness of feeling. As such; she might
prove more to be feared
<a class="pagebreak" name="page281" id="page281" title="281"></a>
than a mere blackmailer whom he could buy off with money. He knew
he was not popular, but he was no worse than the other captains of
industry. It was a cut-throat game at best. Competition was the
soul of commercial life, and if he had outwitted his competitors
and made himself richer than all of them, he was not a criminal
for that. But all these attacks in newspapers and books did not do
him any good. One day the people might take these demagogic
writings seriously and then there would be the devil to pay. He
took up the book again and ran over the pages. This certainly was
no ordinary girl. She knew more and had a more direct way of
saying things than any woman he had ever met. And as he watched
her furtively across the desk he wondered how he could use her;
how instead of being his enemy, he could make her his friend. If
he did not, she would go away and write more such books, and
literature of this kind might become a real peril to his
interests. Money could do anything; it could secure the services
of this woman and prevent her doing further mischief. But how
could he employ her? Suddenly an inspiration came to him. For
some years he had been collecting material for a history of the
Empire Trading Company. She could write it. It
<a class="pagebreak" name="page282" id="page282" title="282"></a>
would practically be his own biography. Would she undertake
it?</p>

<p>Embarrassed by the long silence, Shirley finally broke it by
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn't ask me to call merely to find out what I
thought of my own work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ryder slowly, &ldquo;I want you to do
some work for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened a drawer at the left-hand side of his desk and took
out several sheets of foolscap and a number of letters. Shirley's
heart beat faster as she caught sight of the letters. Were her
father's among them? She wondered what kind of work John Burkett
Ryder had for her to do and if she would do it whatever it was.
Some literary work probably, compiling or something of that kind.
If it was well paid, why should she not accept? There would be
nothing humiliating in it; it would not tie her hands in any way.
She was a professional writer in the market to be employed by
whoever could pay the price. Besides, such work might give her
better opportunities to secure the letters of which she was in
search. Gathering in one pile all the papers he had removed from
the drawer, Mr. Ryder said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to put my biography together from this
material. But first,&rdquo; he added, taking up &ldquo;The
<a class="pagebreak" name="page283" id="page283" title="283"></a>
American Octopus,&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to know where you got the
details of this man's life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the most part&mdash;imagination, newspapers,
magazines,&rdquo; replied Shirley carelessly. &ldquo;You know the
American millionaire is a very overworked topic just now&mdash;and
naturally I've read&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I refer to
what you haven't read&mdash;what you couldn't have read. For
example, here.&rdquo; He turned to a page marked in the book and
read aloud: &ldquo;<i>As an evidence of his petty vanity, when a
youth he had a beautiful Indian girl tattooed just above the
forearm.</i>&rdquo; Ryder leaned eagerly forward as he asked her
searchingly: &ldquo;Now who told you that I had my arm tattooed
when I was a boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; laughed Shirley nervously. &ldquo;What
a curious coincidence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me read you another coincidence,&rdquo; said Ryder
meaningly. He turned to another part of the book and read:
&ldquo;<i>the same eternal long black cigar always between his
lips</i> ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;General Grant smoked, too,&rdquo; interrupted Shirley.
&ldquo;All men who think deeply along material lines seem to
smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we'll let that go. But how about this?&rdquo; He
turned back a few pages and read: &ldquo;<i>John Broderick had
loved, when a young man, a girl who lived in
<a class="pagebreak" name="page284" id="page284" title="284"></a>
Vermont, but circumstances separated them.</i>&rdquo; He stopped
and stared at Shirley a moment and then he said: &ldquo;I loved a
girl when I was a lad and she came from Vermont, and circumstances
separated us. That isn't coincidence, for presently you make John
Broderick marry a young woman who had money. I married a girl with
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of men marry for money,&rdquo; remarked
Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said <i>with</i> money, not for money,&rdquo; retorted
Ryder. Then turning again to the book, he said: &ldquo;Now, this
is what I can't understand, for no one could have told you this
but I myself. Listen.&rdquo; He read aloud: &ldquo;<i>With all his
physical bravery and personal courage, John Broderick was
intensely afraid of death. It was on his mind
constantly.</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; he
demanded somewhat roughly. &ldquo;I swear I've never mentioned it
to a living soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most men who amass money are afraid of death,&rdquo;
replied Shirley with outward composure, &ldquo;for death is about
the only thing that can separate them from their money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder laughed, but it was a hollow, mocking laugh, neither
sincere nor hearty. It was a laugh such as the devil may have
given when driven out of heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're quite a character!&rdquo; He laughed again, and
Shirley, catching the infection, laughed, too.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page285" id="page285" title="285"></a>
<p>&ldquo;It's me and it isn't me,&rdquo; went on Ryder
flourishing the book. &ldquo;This fellow Broderick is all right;
he's successful and he's great, but I don't like his
finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's logical,&rdquo; ventured Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's cruel,&rdquo; insisted Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So is the man who reverses the divine law and hates his
neighbour instead of loving him,&rdquo; retorted Shirley.</p>

<p>She spoke more boldly, beginning to feel more sure of her
ground, and it amused her to fence in this way with the man of
millions. So far, she thought, he had not got the best of her. She
was fast becoming used to him, and her first feeling of
intimidation was passing away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; grunted Ryder, &ldquo;you're a curious girl;
upon my word you interest me!&rdquo; He took the mass of papers
lying at his elbow and pushed them over to her.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to make as clever a
book out of this chaos as you did out of your own
imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley turned the papers over carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you think your life is a good example to
follow?&rdquo; she asked with a tinge of irony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't it?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>The girl looked him square in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we all wanted to follow
it,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page286" id="page286" title="286"></a>
suppose we all wanted to be the richest, the most powerful
personage in the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;what then?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would postpone the era of the Brotherhood of
man indefinitely, don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it from that point of view,&rdquo;
admitted the billionaire. &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;you're an extraordinary girl. Why, you can't be more than
twenty&mdash;or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm twenty-four&mdash;or so,&rdquo; smiled Shirley.</p>

<p>Ryder's face expanded in a broad smile. He admired this girl's
pluck and ready wit. He grew more amiable and tried to gain her
confidence. In a coaxing tone he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, where did you get those details? Take me into your
confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have taken you into my confidence,&rdquo; laughed
Shirley, pointing at her book. &ldquo;It cost you $1.50!&rdquo;
Turning over the papers he had put before her she said presently:
&ldquo;I don't know about this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't think my life would make good reading?&rdquo;
he asked with some asperity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; she replied slowly, as if unwilling to
commit herself as to its commercial or literary value. Then she
said frankly: &ldquo;To tell you the honest truth, I don't
consider mere genius in money-making is sufficient
<a class="pagebreak" name="page287" id="page287" title="287"></a>
provocation for rushing into print. You see, unless you come to a
bad end, it would have no moral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ignoring the not very flattering insinuation contained in this
last speech, the plutocrat continued to urge her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can name your own price if you will do the
work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Two, three or even five thousand
dollars. It's only a few months' work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five thousand dollars?&rdquo; echoed Shirley.
&ldquo;That's a lot of money.&rdquo; Smiling, she added: &ldquo;It
appeals to my commercial sense. But I'm afraid the subject does
not arouse my enthusiasm from an artistic standpoint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder seemed amused at the idea of any one hesitating to make
five thousand dollars. He knew that writers do not run across such
opportunities every day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't know why
I'm so anxious to get you to do the work. I suppose it's because
you don't want to. You remind me of my son. Ah, he's a
problem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley started involuntarily when Ryder mentioned his son. But
he did not notice it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, is he wild?&rdquo; she asked, as if only mildly
interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I wish he were,&rdquo; said Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fallen in love with the wrong woman, I suppose,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page288" id="page288" title="288"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Something of the sort&mdash;how did you guess?&rdquo;
asked Ryder surprised.</p>

<p>Shirley coughed to hide her embarrassment and replied
indifferently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So many boys do that. Besides,&rdquo; she added with a
mischievous twinkle in her eyes, &ldquo;I can hardly imagine that
any woman would be the right one unless you selected her
yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder made no answer. He folded his arms and gazed at her. Who
was this woman who knew him so well, who could read his inmost
thoughts, who never made a mistake? After a silence he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know you say the strangest things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truth is strange,&rdquo; replied Shirley carelessly.
&ldquo;I don't suppose you hear it very often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in that form,&rdquo; admitted Ryder.</p>

<p>Shirley had taken on to her lap some of the letters he had
passed her, and was perusing them one after another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these letters from Washington consulting you on
politics and finance&mdash;they won't interest the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My secretary picked them out,&rdquo; explained Ryder.
&ldquo;Your artistic sense will tell you what to use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does your son still love this girl? I mean the one you
object to?&rdquo; inquired Shirley as she went on sorting the
papers.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page289" id="page289" title="289"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, he does not care for her any more,&rdquo;
answered Ryder hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does; he still loves her,&rdquo; said Shirley
positively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do <i>you</i> know?&rdquo; asked Ryder amazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the way you say he doesn't,&rdquo; retorted
Shirley.</p>

<p>Ryder gave his caller a look in which admiration was mingled
with astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The idiot
does love the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless his heart,&rdquo; said Shirley to herself. Aloud
she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope they'll both outwit you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder laughed in spite of himself. This young woman certainly
interested him more than any other he had ever known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think I ever met anyone in my life quite like
you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the objection to the girl?&rdquo; demanded
Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every objection. I don't want her in my
family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything against her character?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To better conceal the keen interest she took in the personal
turn the conversation had taken, Shirley pretended to be more busy
than ever with the papers.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page290" id="page290" title="290"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is no&mdash;not that I know of,&rdquo;
replied Ryder. &ldquo;But because a woman has a good character,
that doesn't necessarily make her a desirable match, does
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a point in her favor, isn't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated as if uncertain
what to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know men well, don't you, Mr. Ryder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've met enough to know them pretty well,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you study women for a change?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;That would enable you to understand a great many
things that I don't think are quite clear to you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder laughed good humouredly. It was decidedly a novel
sensation to have someone lecturing him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm studying you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I don't
seem to make much headway. A woman like you whose mind isn't
spoiled by the amusement habit has great possibilities&mdash;great
possibilities. Do you know you're the first woman I ever took into
my confidence&mdash;I mean at sight?&rdquo; Again he fixed her
with that keen glance which in his business life had taught him
how to read men. He continued: &ldquo;I'm acting on
sentiment&mdash;something I rarely do, but I can't help it. I
<a class="pagebreak" name="page291" id="page291" title="291"></a>
like you, upon my soul I do, and I'm going to introduce you to my
wife&mdash;my son&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the telephone from his desk as if he were going to use
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a commander-in-chief you would have made&mdash;how
natural it is for you to command,&rdquo; exclaimed Shirley in a
burst of admiration that was half real, half mocking. &ldquo;I
suppose you always tell people what they are to do and how they
are to do it. You are a born general. You know I've often thought
that Napoleon and C&aelig;sar and Alexander must have been great
domestic leaders as well as imperial rulers. I'm sure of it
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder listened to her in amazement. He was not quite sure if
she were making fun of him or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all&mdash;&rdquo; he began. Then interrupting
himself he said amiably: &ldquo;Won't you do me the honour to meet
my family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley smiled sweetly and bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Ryder, I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose from her seat and leaned over the manuscripts to
conceal the satisfaction this promise of an introduction to the
family circle gave her. She was quick to see that it meant more
visits to the house, and other and perhaps better opportunities to
find the objects of her search. Ryder lifted the receiver of his
<a class="pagebreak" name="page292" id="page292" title="292"></a>
telephone and talked to his secretary in another room, while
Shirley, who was still standing, continued examining the papers
and letters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Bagley? What's that? General Dodge? Get rid
of him. I can't see him to-day. Tell him to come to-morrow.
What's that? My son wants to see me? Tell him to come to the
phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that instant Shirley gave a little cry, which in vain she
tried to suppress. Ryder looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he demanded startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing!&rdquo; she replied in a hoarse
whisper. &ldquo;I pricked myself with a pin. Don't mind
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had just come across her father's missing letters, which
had got mixed up, evidently without Ryder's knowledge, in the mass
of papers he had handed her. Prepared as she was to find the
letters somewhere in the house, she never dreamed that fate would
put them so easily and so quickly into her hands; the suddenness
of their appearance and the sight of her father's familiar
signature affected her almost like a shock. Now she had them, she
must not let them go again; yet how could she keep them
unobserved? Could she conceal them? Would he miss them? She tried
to slip them in her bosom while Ryder was busy at the 'phone, but
he suddenly glanced in her direction and caught her eye. She still
held the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page293" id="page293" title="293"></a>
letters in her hand, which shook from nervousness, but he noticed
nothing and went on speaking through the 'phone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo, Jefferson, boy! You want to see me. Can you wait
till I'm through? I've got a lady here. Going away? Nonsense!
Determined, eh? Well, I can't keep you here if you've made up your
mind. You want to say good-bye. Come up in about five minutes and
I'll introduce you to a very interesting person,&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed and hung up the receiver. Shirley was all unstrung,
trying to overcome the emotion which her discovery had caused her,
and in a strangely altered voice, the result of the nervous strain
she was under, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want me to come here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up from the letters she was reading across to Ryder,
who was standing watching her on the other side of the desk. He
caught her glance and, leaning over to take some manuscript, he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don't want these papers to get&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eye suddenly rested on the letters she was holding. He
stopped short, and reaching forward he tried to snatch them from
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>He took the letters and she made no resistance. It
<a class="pagebreak" name="page294" id="page294" title="294"></a>
would be folly to force the issue now, she thought. Another
opportunity would present itself. Ryder locked the letters up very
carefully in the drawer on the left-hand side of his desk,
muttering to himself rather than speaking to Shirley:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How on earth did they get among my other
papers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Judge Rossmore, were they not?&rdquo; said Shirley
boldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know it was Judge Rossmore?&rdquo; demanded
Ryder suspiciously. &ldquo;I didn't know that his name had been
mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw his signature,&rdquo; she said simply. Then she
added: &ldquo;He's the father of the girl you don't like, isn't
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he's the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cloud came over the financier's face; his eyes darkened, his
jaws snapped and he clenched his fist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you must hate him!&rdquo; said Shirley, who observed
the change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Ryder recovering his
self-possession and suavity of manner. &ldquo;I disagree with his
politics and his methods, but&mdash;I know very little about him
except that he is about to be removed from office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About to be?&rdquo; echoed Shirley. &ldquo;So his fate
is
<a class="pagebreak" name="page295" id="page295" title="295"></a>
decided even before he is tried?&rdquo; The girl laughed bitterly.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;some of the newspapers are
beginning to think he is innocent of the things of which he is
accused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; said Ryder indifferently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she persisted, &ldquo;most people are on his
side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She planted her elbows on the desk in front of her, and looking
him squarely in the face, she asked him point blank:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose side are you on&mdash;really and truly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder winced. What right had this woman, a stranger both to
Judge Rossmore and himself, to come here and catechise him? He
restrained his impatience with difficulty as he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose side am I on? Oh, I don't know that I am on any
side. I don't know that I give it much thought.
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think this man deserves to be punished?&rdquo;
she demanded.</p>

<p>She had resumed her seat at the desk and partly regained her
self-possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask? What is your interest in this
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she replied evasively; &ldquo;his
case interests me, that's all. Its rather romantic. Your
<a class="pagebreak" name="page296" id="page296" title="296"></a>
son loves this man's daughter. He is in disgrace&mdash;many seem
to think unjustly.&rdquo; Her voice trembled with emotion as she
continued: &ldquo;I have heard from one source or
another&mdash;you know I am acquainted with a number of newspaper
men&mdash;I have heard that life no longer has any interest for
him, that he is not only disgraced but beggared, that he is pining
away slowly, dying of a broken heart, that his wife and daughter
are in despair. Tell me, do you think he deserves such a
fate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder remained thoughtful a moment, and then he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thinking that she had touched his sympathies, Shirley followed
up her advantage:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then, why not come to his rescue&mdash;you, who are
so rich, so powerful; you, who can move the scales of justice at
your will&mdash;save this man from humiliation and
disgrace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder shrugged his shoulders, and his face expressed weariness,
as if the subject had begun to bore him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, you don't understand. His removal is
necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley's face became set and hard. There was a contemptuous
ring to her words as she retorted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you admit that he may be innocent!&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page297" id="page297" title="297"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Even if I knew it as a fact, I couldn't move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that if you had positive
proof?&rdquo; She pointed to the drawer in the desk where he had
placed the letters. &ldquo;If you had absolute proof in that
drawer, for instance? Wouldn't you help him then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder's face grew cold and inscrutable; he now wore his
fighting mask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even if I had the absolute proof in that
drawer?&rdquo; he snapped viciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you absolute proof in that drawer?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I repeat that even if I had, I could not expose the men
who have been my friends. Its <i>noblesse oblige</i> in politics
as well as in society, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled again at her, as if he had recovered his good humour
after their sharp passage at arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it's politics&mdash;that's what the papers said. And
you believe him innocent. Well, you must have some grounds for
your belief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said that even if you had the proofs, you could not
produce them without sacrificing your friends, showing that your
friends are interested in having this man put off the
bench&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped and burst into hysterical
laughter. &ldquo;Oh, I think you're
<a class="pagebreak" name="page298" id="page298" title="298"></a>
having a joke at my expense,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;just to
see how far you can lead me. I daresay Judge Rossmore deserves all
he gets. Oh, yes&mdash;I'm sure he deserves it.&rdquo; She rose
and walked to the other side of the room to conceal her
emotion.</p>

<p>Ryder watched her curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady, how you take this matter to
heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please forgive me,&rdquo; laughed Shirley, and averting
her face to conceal the fact that her eyes were filled with tears.
&ldquo;It's my artistic temperament, I suppose. It's always
getting me into trouble. It appealed so strongly to my
sympathies&mdash;this story of hopeless love between two young
people&mdash;with the father of the girl hounded by corrupt
politicians and unscrupulous financiers. It was too much for me.
Ah! ah! I forgot where I was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaned against a chair, sick and faint from nervousness,
her whole body trembling. At that moment there was a knock at the
library door and Jefferson Ryder appeared. Not seeing Shirley,
whose back was towards him, he advanced to greet his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me to come up in five minutes,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I just wanted to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Green,&rdquo; said Ryder, Sr., addressing Shirley
and ignoring whatever it was that the young man
<a class="pagebreak" name="page299" id="page299" title="299"></a>
wanted to say, &ldquo;this is my son Jefferson. Jeff&mdash;this is
Miss Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson looked in the direction indicated and stood as if
rooted to the floor. He was so surprised that he was struck dumb.
Finally, recovering himself, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shirley!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Shirley Green, the author,&rdquo; explained Ryder,
Sr., not noticing the note of familiar recognition in his
exclamation.</p>

<p>Shirley advanced, and holding out her hand to Jefferson, said
demurely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very pleased to meet you, Mr. Ryder.&rdquo; Then
quickly, in an undertone, she added: &ldquo;Be careful; don't
betray me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson was so astounded that he did not see the outstretched
hand. All he could do was to stand and stare first at her and then
at his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you shake hands with her?&rdquo; said Ryder,
Sr. &ldquo;She won't bite you.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;Miss
Green is going to do some literary work for me, so we shall see a
great deal of her. It's too bad you're going away!&rdquo; He
chuckled at his own pleasantry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; blurted out Jefferson, &ldquo;I came to
say that I've changed my mind. You did not want me to go, and I
feel I ought to do something to please you.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page300" id="page300" title="300"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; said Ryder pleased. &ldquo;Now you're
talking common sense,&rdquo; He turned to Shirley, who was getting
ready to make her departure: &ldquo;Well, Miss Green, we may
consider the matter settled. You undertake the work at the price I
named and finish it as soon as you can. Of course, you will have
to consult me a good deal as you go along, so I think it would be
better for you to come and stay here while the work is
progressing. Mrs. Ryder can give you a suite of rooms to yourself,
where you will be undisturbed and you will have all your material
close at hand. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley was silent for a moment. She looked first at Ryder and
then at his son, and from them her glance went to the little
drawer on the left-hand side of the desk. Then she said
quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you think best, Mr. Ryder. I am quite willing to do
the work here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr., escorted her to the top of the landing and watched
her as she passed down the grand staircase, ushered by the
gorgeously uniformed flunkies, to the front door and the
street.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page301" id="page301" title="301"></a>
<a name="chapter13" id="chapter13"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>Shirley entered upon her new duties in the Ryder household two
days later. She had returned to her rooms the evening of her
meeting with the financier in a state bordering upon hysteria. The
day's events had been so extraordinary that it seemed to her they
could not be real, and that she must be in a dream. The car ride
to Seventy-fourth Street, the interview in the library, the
discovery of her father's letters, the offer to write the
biography, and, what to her was still more important, the
invitation to go and live in the Ryder home&mdash;all these
incidents were so remarkable and unusual that it was only with
difficulty that the girl persuaded herself that they were not
figments of a disordered brain.</p>

<p>But it was all true enough. The next morning's mail brought a
letter from Mrs. Ryder, who wrote to the effect that Mr. Ryder
would like the work to begin at once, and adding that a suite of
rooms would be ready for her the following afternoon. Shirley did
not hesitate. Everything was to be gained
<a class="pagebreak" name="page302" id="page302" title="302"></a>
by making the Ryder residence her headquarters, her father's very
life depended upon the successful outcome of her present mission,
and this unhoped for opportunity practically ensured success. She
immediately wrote to Massapequa. One letter was to her mother,
saying that she was extending her visit beyond the time originally
planned. The other letter was to Stott. She told him all about the
interview with Ryder, informed him of the discovery of the
letters, and after explaining the nature of the work offered to
her, said that her address for the next few weeks would be in care
of John Burkett Ryder. All was going better than she had dared to
hope. Everything seemed to favour their plan. Her first step, of
course, while in the Ryder home, would be to secure possession of
her father's letters, and these she would dispatch at once to
Massapequa, so they could be laid before the Senate without
delay.</p>

<p>So, after settling accounts with her landlady and packing up
her few belongings, Shirley lost no time in transferring herself
to the more luxurious quarters provided for her in the
ten-million-dollar mansion uptown.</p>

<p>At the Ryder house she was received cordially and with every
mark of consideration. The housekeeper came down to the main hall
to greet her when she
<a class="pagebreak" name="page303" id="page303" title="303"></a>
arrived and escorted her to the suite of rooms, comprising a small
working library, a bedroom simply but daintily furnished in pink
and white and a private bathroom, which had been specially
prepared for her convenience and comfort, and here presently she
was joined by Mrs. Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; exclaimed the financier's wife, staring
curiously at Shirley, &ldquo;what a young girl you are to have
made such a stir with a book! How did you do it? I'm sure I
couldn't. It's as much as I can do to write a letter, and half the
time that's not legible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wasn't so hard,&rdquo; laughed Shirley. &ldquo;It
was the subject that appealed rather than any special skill of
mine. The trusts and their misdeeds are the favourite topics of
the hour. The whole country is talking about nothing else. My book
came at the right time, that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although &ldquo;The American Octopus&rdquo; was a direct attack
on her own husband, Mrs. Ryder secretly admired this young woman,
who had dared to speak a few blunt truths. It was a courage which,
alas! she had always lacked herself, but there was a certain
satisfaction in knowing there were women in the world not entirely
cowed by the tyrant Man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always wanted a daughter,&rdquo; went on Mrs.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page304" id="page304" title="304"></a>
Ryder, becoming confidential, while Shirley removed her things and
made herself at home; &ldquo;girls of your age are so
companionable.&rdquo; Then, abruptly, she asked: &ldquo;Do your
parents live in New York?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley's face flushed and she stooped over her trunk to hide
her embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not at present,&rdquo; she answered evasively.
&ldquo;My mother and father are in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was afraid that more questions of a personal nature would
follow, but apparently Mrs. Ryder was not in an inquisitive mood,
for she asked nothing further. She only said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a son, but I don't see much of him. You must meet
my Jefferson. He is such a nice boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley tried to look unconcerned as she replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met him yesterday. Mr. Ryder introduced him to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor lad, he has his troubles too,&rdquo; went on Mrs.
Ryder. &ldquo;He's in love with a girl, but his father wants him
to marry someone else. They're quarrelling over it all the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="movquote2" id="movquote2"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Parents shouldn't interfere in matters of the
heart,&rdquo; said Shirley decisively. &ldquo;What is more serious
than the choosing of a life companion, and who are better entitled
to make a free selection than they who are going to spend the rest
of their days together?
<a class="pagebreak" name="page305" id="page305" title="305"></a>
Of course, it is a father's duty to give his son the benefit of
his riper experience, but to insist on a marriage based only on
business interests is little less than a crime. There are
considerations more important if the union is to be a happy or a
lasting one. The chief thing is that the man should feel real
attachment for the woman he marries. Two people who are to live
together as man and wife must be compatible in tastes and temper.
You cannot mix oil and water. It is these selfish marriages which
keep our divorce courts busy. Money alone won't buy happiness in
marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Ryder, &ldquo;no one knows that
better than I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The financier's wife was already most favourably impressed with
her guest, and she chatted on as if she had known Shirley for
years. It was rarely that she had heard so young a woman express
such common-sense views, and the more she talked with her the less
surprised she was that she was the author of a much-discussed
book. Finally, thinking that Shirley might prefer to be alone, she
rose to go, bidding her make herself thoroughly at home and to
ring for anything she might wish. A maid had been assigned to look
exclusively after her wants, and she could have her meals served
in her room or else have them
<a class="pagebreak" name="page306" id="page306" title="306"></a>
with the family as she liked. But Shirley, not caring to encounter
Mr. Ryder's cold, searching stare more often than necessary, said
she would prefer to take her meals alone.</p>

<p>Left to herself, Shirley settled down to work in earnest. Mr.
Ryder had sent to her room all the material for the biography, and
soon she was completely absorbed in the task of sorting and
arranging letters, making extracts from records, compiling data,
etc., laying the foundations for the important book she was to
write. She wondered what they would call it, and she smiled as a
peculiarly appropriate title flashed through her
mind&mdash;&ldquo;The History of a Crime.&rdquo; Yet she thought
they could hardly infringe on Victor Hugo; perhaps the best title
was the simplest &ldquo;The History of the Empire Trading
Company.&rdquo; Everyone would understand that it told the story
of John Burkett Ryder's remarkable career from his earliest
beginnings to the present time. She worked feverishly all that
evening getting the material into shape, and the following day
found her early at her desk. No one disturbed her and she wrote
steadily on until noon, Mrs. Ryder only once putting her head in
the door to wish her good morning.</p>

<p>After luncheon, Shirley decided that the weather was too
glorious to remain indoors. Her health must
<a class="pagebreak" name="page307" id="page307" title="307"></a>
not be jeopardized even to advance the interests of the Colossus,
so she put on her hat and left the house to go for a walk. The air
smelled sweet to her after being confined so long indoor, and she
walked with a more elastic and buoyant step than she had since her
return home. Turning down Fifth Avenue, she entered the park at
Seventy-second Street, following the pathway until she came to the
bend in the driveway opposite the Casino. The park was almost
deserted at that hour, and there was a delightful sense of
solitude and a sweet scent of new-mown hay from the freshly cut
lawns. She found an empty bench, well shaded by an overspreading
tree, and she sat down, grateful for the rest and quiet.</p>

<p>She wondered what Jefferson thought of her action in coming to
his father's house practically in disguise and under an assumed
name. She must see him at once, for in him lay her hope of
obtaining possession of the letters. Certainly she felt no
delicacy or compunction in asking Jefferson to do her this
service. The letters belonged to her father and they were being
wrongfully withheld with the deliberate purpose of doing him an
injury. She had a moral if not a legal right to recover the
letters in any way that she could.</p>

<p>She was so deeply engrossed in her thoughts that
<a class="pagebreak" name="page308" id="page308" title="308"></a>
she had not noticed a hansom cab which suddenly drew up with a
jerk at the curb opposite her bench. A man jumped out. It was
Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Shirley,&rdquo; he cried gaily; &ldquo;who would
have expected to find you rusticating on a bench here? I pictured
you grinding away at home doing literary stunts for the
governor.&rdquo; He grinned and then added: &ldquo;Come for a
drive. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley demurred. No, she could not spare the time. Yet, she
thought to herself, why was not this a good opportunity to explain
to Jefferson how he came to find her in his father's library
masquerading under another name, and also to ask him to secure the
letters for her? While she pondered Jefferson insisted, and a few
minutes later she found herself sitting beside him in the cab.
They started off at a brisk pace, Shirley sitting with her head
back, enjoying the strong breeze caused by the rapid motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what does it all
mean? I was so startled at seeing you in the library the other
day that I almost betrayed you. How did you come to call on
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Briefly Shirley explained everything. She told him how Mr.
Ryder had written to her asking her to call and see him, and how
she had eagerly seized at this last straw in the hope of helping
her father.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page309" id="page309" title="309"></a>
She told him about the letters, explaining how necessary they were
for her father's defence and how she had discovered them. Mr.
Ryder, she said, had seemed to take a fancy to her and had asked
her to remain in the house as his guest while she was compiling
his biography, and she had accepted the offer, not so much for the
amount of money involved as for the splendid opportunity it
afforded her to gain possession of the letters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is the mysterious work you spoke of&mdash;to get
those letters?&rdquo; said Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is my mission. It was a secret. I couldn't
tell you; I couldn't tell anyone. Only Judge Stott knows. He is
aware I have found them and is hourly expecting to receive them
from me. And now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want your
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His only answer was to grasp tighter the hand she had laid in
his. She knew that she would not have to explain the nature of the
service she wanted. He understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the letters?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the left-hand drawer of your father's desk,&rdquo;
she answered.</p>

<p>He was silent for a few moments, and then he said simply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will get them.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page310" id="page310" title="310"></a>
<p>The cab by this time had got as far as Claremont, and from the
hill summit they had a splendid view of the broad sweep of the
majestic Hudson and the towering walls of the blue palisades. The
day was so beautiful and the air so invigorating that Jefferson
suggested a ramble along the banks of the river. They could leave
the cab at Claremont and drive back to the city later. Shirley was
too grateful to him for his promise of coöperation to make any
further opposition, and soon they were far away from beaten
highways, down on the banks of the historic stream, picking
flowers and laughing merrily like two truant children bent on a
self-made holiday. The place they had reached was just outside the
northern boundaries of Harlem, a sylvan spot still unspoiled by
the rude invasion of the flat-house builder. The land, thickly
wooded, sloped down sharply to the water, and the perfect quiet
was broken only by the washing of the tiny surf against the river
bank and the shrill notes of the birds in the trees.</p>

<p>Although it was late in October the day was warm, and Shirley
soon tired of climbing over bramble-entangled verdure. The rich
grass underfoot looked cool and inviting, and the natural slope of
the ground affording an ideal resting-place, she sat there, with
Jefferson stretched out at her feet, both watching
<a class="pagebreak" name="page311" id="page311" title="311"></a>
idly the dancing waters of the broad Hudson, spangled with gleams
of light, as they swept swiftly by on their journey to the
sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shirley,&rdquo; said Jefferson suddenly, &ldquo;I
suppose you saw that ridiculous story about my alleged engagement
to Miss Roberts. I hope you understood that it was done without my
consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I did not guess it, Jeff,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;your assurance would be sufficient. Besides,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;what right have I to object?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want you to have the right,&rdquo; he replied
earnestly. &ldquo;I'm going to stop this Roberts nonsense in a way
my father hardly anticipates. I'm just waiting a chance to talk to
him. I'll show him the absurdity of announcing me engaged to a
girl who is about to elope with his private secretary!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elope with the secretary?&rdquo; exclaimed Shirley.</p>

<p>Jefferson told her all about the letter he had found on the
staircase, and the Hon. Fitzroy Bagley's plans for a runaway
marriage with the senator's wealthy daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a godsend to me,&rdquo; he said gleefully.
&ldquo;Their plan is to get married next Wednesday. I'll see my
father on Tuesday; I'll put the evidence in his hands, and I don't
think,&rdquo; he added grimly, &ldquo;he'll bother me any more
about Miss Roberts.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page312" id="page312" title="312"></a>
<p>&ldquo;So you're not going away now?&rdquo; said Shirley,
smiling down at him.</p>

<p>He sat up and leaned over towards her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't, Shirley, I simply can't,&rdquo; he replied, his
voice trembling. &ldquo;You are more to me than I dreamed a woman
could ever be. I realize it more forcibly every day. There is no
use fighting against it. Without you, my work, my life means
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley shook her head and averted her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't let us speak of that, Jeff,&rdquo; she pleaded
gently. &ldquo;I told you I did not belong to myself while my
father was in peril.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must speak of it,&rdquo; he interrupted.
&ldquo;Shirley, you do yourself an injustice as well as me. You
are not indifferent to me&mdash;I feel that. Then why raise this
barrier between us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A soft light stole into the girl's eyes. Ah, it was good to
feel there was someone to whom she was everything in the
world!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't ask me to betray my trust, Jeff,&rdquo; she
faltered. &ldquo;You know I am not indifferent to you&mdash;far
from it. But I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came closer until his face nearly touched hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you&mdash;I want you,&rdquo; he murmured
feverishly. &ldquo;Give me the right to claim you before all the
world as my future wife!&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page313" id="page313" title="313"></a>
<p>Every note of his rich, manly voice, vibrating with impetuous
passion, sounded in Shirley's ear like a soft caress. She closed
her eyes. A strange feeling of languor was stealing over her, a
mysterious thrill passed through her whole body. The eternal,
inevitable sex instinct was disturbing, for the first time, a
woman whose life had been singularly free from such influences,
putting to flight all the calculations and resolves her cooler
judgment had made. The sensuous charm of the place&mdash;the
distant splash of the water, the singing of the birds, the
fragrance of the trees and grass&mdash;all these symbols of the
joy of life conspired to arouse the love-hunger of the woman. Why,
after all, should she not know happiness like other women? She had
a sacred duty to perform, it was true; but would it be less well
done because she declined to stifle the natural leanings of her
womanhood? Both her soul and her body called out: &ldquo;Let this
man love you, give yourself to him, he is worthy of your
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half unconsciously, she listened to his ardent wooing, her eyes
shut, as he spoke quickly, passionately, his breath warm upon her
cheek:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shirley, I offer you all the devotion a man can give a
woman. Say the one word that will make me the happiest or the most
wretched of men. Yes or
<a class="pagebreak" name="page314" id="page314" title="314"></a>
no! Only think well before you wreck my life. I love you&mdash;I
love you! I will wait for you if need be until the crack of doom.
Say&mdash;say you will be my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She opened her eyes. His face was bent close over hers. Their
lips almost touched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jefferson,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I do love
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His lips met hers in a long, passionate kiss. Her eyes closed
and an ecstatic thrill seemed to convulse her entire being. The
birds in the trees overhead sang in more joyful chorus in
celebration of the betrothal.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page315" id="page315" title="315"></a>
<a name="chapter14" id="chapter14"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>It was nearly seven o'clock when Shirley got back to
Seventy-fourth Street. No one saw her come in, and she went direct
to her room, and after a hasty dinner, worked until late into the
night on her book to make up for lost time. The events of the
afternoon caused her considerable uneasiness. She reproached
herself for her weakness and for having yielded so readily to the
impulse of the moment. She had said only what was the truth when
she admitted she loved Jefferson, but what right had she to
dispose of her future while her father's fate was still uncertain?
Her conscience troubled her, and when she came to reason it out
calmly, the more impossible seemed their union from every point of
view. How could she become the daughter-in-law of the man who had
ruined her own father? The idea was preposterous, and hard as the
sacrifice would be, Jefferson must be made to see it in that
light. Their engagement was the greatest folly; it bound each of
them when nothing but unhappiness could
<a class="pagebreak" name="page316" id="page316" title="316"></a>
possibly come of it. She was sure now that she loved Jefferson. It
would be hard to give him up, but there are times and
circumstances when duty and principle must prevail over all other
considerations, and this she felt was one of them.</p>

<p>The following morning she received a letter from Stott. He was
delighted to hear the good news regarding her important discovery,
and he urged her to lose no time in securing the letters and
forwarding them to Massapequa, when he would immediately go to
Washington and lay them before the Senate. Documentary evidence
of that conclusive nature, he went on to say, would prove of the
very highest value in clearing her father's name. He added that
the judge and her mother were as well as circumstances would
permit, and that they were not in the least worried about her
protracted absence. Her Aunt Milly had already returned to Europe,
and Eudoxia was still threatening to leave daily.</p>

<p>Shirley needed no urging. She quite realized the importance of
acting quickly, but it was not easy to get at the letters. The
library was usually kept locked when the great man was away, and
on the few occasions when access to it was possible, the lynx-eyed
Mr. Bagley was always on guard. Short as had been her stay in the
Ryder household, Shirley already
<a class="pagebreak" name="page317" id="page317" title="317"></a>
shared Jefferson's antipathy to the English secretary, whose
manner grew more supercilious and overbearing as he drew nearer
the date when he expected to run off with one of the richest
catches of the season. He had not sought the acquaintance of his
employer's biographer since her arrival, and, with the exception
of a rude stare, had not deigned to notice her, which attitude of
haughty indifference was all the more remarkable in view of the
fact that the Hon. Fitzroy usually left nothing unturned to
cultivate a flirtatious intimacy with every attractive female he
met. The truth was that what with Mr. Ryder's demands upon his
services and his own preparations for his coming matrimonial
venture, in which he had so much at stake, he had neither time nor
inclination to indulge his customary amorous diversions.</p>

<p>Miss Roberts had called at the house several times, ostensibly
to see Mrs. Ryder, and when introduced to Shirley she had
condescended to give the latter a supercilious nod. Her
conversation was generally of the silly, vacuous sort, concerning
chiefly new dresses or bonnets, and Shirley at once read her
character&mdash;frivolous, amusement-loving, empty-headed,
irresponsible&mdash;just the kind of girl to do something foolish
without weighing the consequences. After chatting
<a class="pagebreak" name="page318" id="page318" title="318"></a>
a few moments with Mrs. Ryder she would usually vanish, and one
day, after one of these mysterious disappearances, Shirley
happened to pass the library and caught sight of her and Mr.
Bagley conversing in subdued and eager tones. It was very evident
that the elopement scheme was fast maturing. If the scandal was to
be prevented, Jefferson ought to see his father and acquaint him
with the facts without delay. It was probable that at the same
time he would make an effort to secure the letters. Meantime she
must be patient. Too much hurry might spoil everything.</p>

<p>So the days passed, Shirley devoting almost all her time to the
history she had undertaken. She saw nothing of Ryder, Sr., but a
good deal of his wife, to whom she soon became much attached. She
found her an amiable, good-natured woman, entirely free from that
offensive arrogance and patronizing condescension which usually
marks the parvenue as distinct from the thoroughbred. Mrs. Ryder
had no claims to distinguished lineage; on the contrary, she was
the daughter of a country grocer when the then rising oil man
married her, and of educational advantages she had had little or
none. It was purely by accident that she was the wife of the
richest man in the world, and while she enjoyed the prestige her
husband's prominence gave her, she never allowed it to turn her
<a class="pagebreak" name="page319" id="page319" title="319"></a>
head. She gave away large sums for charitable purposes and,
strange to say, when the gift came direct from her, the money was
never returned on the plea that it was &ldquo;tainted.&rdquo; She
shared her husband's dislike for entertaining, and led practically
the life of a recluse. The advent of Shirley, therefore, into her
quiet and uneventful existence was as welcome as sunshine when it
breaks through the clouds after days of gloom. Quite a friendship
sprang up between the two women, and when tired of writing,
Shirley would go into Mrs. Ryder's room and chat until the
financier's wife began to look forward to these little impromptu
visits, so much she enjoyed them.</p>

<p>Nothing more had been said concerning Jefferson and Miss
Roberts. The young man had not yet seen his father, but his mother
knew he was only waiting an opportunity to demand an explanation
of the engagement announcements. Her husband, on the other hand,
desired the match more than ever, owing to the continued
importunities of Senator Roberts. As usual, Mrs. Ryder confided
these little domestic troubles to Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jefferson,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is very angry. He is
determined not to marry the girl, and when he and his father do
meet there'll be another scene.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page320" id="page320" title="320"></a>
<p>&ldquo;What objection has your son to Miss Roberts?&rdquo;
inquired Shirley innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the usual reason,&rdquo; sighed the mother,
&ldquo;and I've no doubt he knows best. He's in love with another
girl&mdash;a Miss Rossmore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered Shirley simply. &ldquo;Mr.
Ryder spoke of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryder was silent, and presently she left the girl alone
with her work.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Shirley was in her room busy writing when
there came a tap at her door. Thinking it was another visit from
Mrs. Ryder, she did not look up, but cried out pleasantly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Ryder entered. He smiled cordially and, as if apologizing
for the intrusion, said amiably:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I'd run up to see how you were getting
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His coming was so unexpected that for a moment Shirley was
startled, but she quickly regained her composure and asked him to
take a seat. He seemed pleased to find her making such good
progress, and he stopped to answer a number of questions she put
to him. Shirley tried to be cordial, but when she looked well at
him and noted the keen, hawk-like eyes, the cruel, vindictive
lines about the mouth, the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page321" id="page321" title="321"></a>
square-set, relentless jaw&mdash;Wall Street had gone wrong with
the Colossus that day and he was still wearing his war
paint&mdash;she recalled the wrong this man had done her father
and she felt how bitterly she hated him. The more her mind dwelt
upon it, the more exasperated she was to think she should be
there, a guest, under his roof, and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that she remained civil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the moral of your life?&rdquo; she demanded
bluntly.</p>

<p>He was quick to note the contemptuous tone in her voice, and he
gave her a keen, searching look as if he were trying to read her
thoughts and fathom the reason for her very evident hostility
towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, What can you show as your life work? Most men
whose lives are big enough to call for biographies have done
something useful&mdash;they have been famous statesmen, eminent
scientists, celebrated authors, great inventors. What have you
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question appeared to stagger him. The audacity of any one
putting such a question to a man in his own house was incredible.
He squared his jaws and his clenched fist descended heavily on the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I have built
up the greatest fortune ever accumulated by one man.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page322" id="page322" title="322"></a>
My fabulous wealth has caused my name to spread to the four
corners of the earth. Is that not an achievement to relate to
future generations?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley gave a little shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Future generations will take no interest in you or your
millions,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;Our civilization will
have made such progress by that time that people will merely
wonder why we, in our day, tolerated men of your class so long.
Now it is different. The world is money-mad. You are a person of
importance in the eyes of the unthinking multitude, but it only
envies you your fortune; it does not admire you personally. When
you die people will count your millions, not your good
deeds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed cynically and drew up a chair near her desk. As a
general thing, John Ryder never wasted words on women. He had but
a poor opinion of their mentality, and considered it beneath the
dignity of any man to enter into serious argument with a woman.
In fact, it was seldom he condescended to argue with anyone. He
gave orders and talked to people; he had no patience to be talked
to. Yet he found himself listening with interest to this young
woman who expressed herself so frankly. It was a decided novelty
for him to hear the truth.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page323" id="page323" title="323"></a>
<p>&ldquo;What do I care what the world says when I'm dead?&rdquo;
he asked with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do care,&rdquo; replied Shirley gravely. &ldquo;You
may school yourself to believe that you are indifferent to the
good opinion of your fellow man, but right down in your heart you
do care&mdash;every man does, whether he be multi-millionaire or a
sneak thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You class the two together, I notice,&rdquo; he said
bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is often a distinction without a difference,&rdquo;
she rejoined promptly.</p>

<p>He remained silent for a moment or two toying nervously with a
paper knife. Then, arrogantly, and as if anxious to impress her
with his importance, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most men would be satisfied if they had accomplished
what I have. Do you realize that my wealth is so vast that I
scarcely know myself what I am worth? What my fortune will be in
another fifty years staggers the imagination. Yet I started with
nothing. I made it all myself. Surely I should get credit for
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>How</i> did you make it?&rdquo; retorted Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In America we don't ask how a man makes his money; we
ask if he has got any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; replied Shirley earnestly.
&ldquo;America is waking up. The conscience of the nation
<a class="pagebreak" name="page324" id="page324" title="324"></a>
is being aroused. We are coming to realize that the scandals of
the last few years were only the fruit of public indifference to
sharp business practice. The people will soon ask the dishonest
rich man where he got it, and there will have to be an accounting.
<a name="insquote6" id="insquote6"></a>
What account will you be able to give?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bit his lip and looked at her for a moment without replying.
Then, with a faint suspicion of a sneer, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a socialist&mdash;perhaps an
anarchist!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the ignorant commit the blunder of confounding the
two,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Anarchy is a disease; socialism
is a science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; he exclaimed mockingly, &ldquo;I thought
the terms were synonymous. The world regards them both as
insane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herself an enthusiastic convert to the new political faith that
was rising like a flood tide all over the world, the contemptuous
tone in which this plutocrat spoke of the coming reorganization of
society which was destined to destroy him and his kind spurred her
on to renewed argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; she said sarcastically, &ldquo;that
you would hardly approve any social reform which threatened to
interfere with your own business methods. But no matter how you
disapprove of socialism on general
<a class="pagebreak" name="page325" id="page325" title="325"></a>
principles, as a leader of the capitalist class you should
understand what socialism is, and not confuse one of the most
important movements in modern world-history with the crazy
theories of irresponsible cranks. The anarchists are the natural
enemies of the entire human family, and would destroy it were
their dangerous doctrines permitted to prevail; the socialists, on
the contrary, are seeking to save mankind from the degradation,
the crime and the folly into which such men as you have driven
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke impetuously, with the inspired exaltation of a
prophet delivering a message to the people. Ryder listened,
concealing his impatience with uneasy little coughs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I am a socialist and I
am proud of it. The whole world is slowly drifting toward
socialism as the only remedy for the actual intolerable
conditions. It may not come in our time, but it will come as
surely as the sun will rise and set tomorrow. Has not the flag of
socialism waved recently from the White House? Has not a President
of the United States declared that the State must eventually curb
the great fortunes? What is that but socialism?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; retorted Ryder grimly, &ldquo;and that
little speech intended for the benefit of the gallery will cost
him the nomination at the next Presidential election.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page326" id="page326" title="326"></a>
We don't want in the White House a President who stirs up class
hatred. Our rich men have a right to what is their own; that is
guaranteed them by the Constitution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it their own?&rdquo; interrupted Shirley.</p>

<p>Ryder ignored the insinuation and proceeded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of our boasted free institutions if a man is to be
restricted in what he may and may not do? If I am clever enough
to accumulate millions who can stop me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people will stop you,&rdquo; said Shirley calmly.
&ldquo;It is only a question of time. Their patience is about
exhausted. Put your ear to the ground and listen to the distant
rumbling of the tempest which, sooner or later, will be unchained
in this land, provoked by the iniquitous practices of organized
capital. The people have had enough of the extortions of the
Trusts. One day they will rise in their wrath and seize by the
throat this knavish plutocracy which, confident in the power of
its wealth to procure legal immunity and reckless of its danger,
persists in robbing the public daily. But retribution is at hand.
The growing discontent of the proletariat, the ever-increasing
strikes and labour disputes of all kinds, the clamour against the
Railroads and the Trusts, the evidence of collusion between
both&mdash;all this is the writing
<a class="pagebreak" name="page327" id="page327" title="327"></a>
on the wall. The capitalistic system is doomed; socialism will
succeed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is socialism?&rdquo; he demanded scornfully.
&ldquo;What will it give the public that it has not got
already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley, who never neglected an opportunity to make a convert,
no matter how hardened he might be, picked up a little pamphlet
printed for propaganda purposes which she had that morning
received by mail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is one of the best and
clearest definitions of socialism I have ever read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Socialism is common ownership of natural resources and
public utilities, and the common operation of all industries for
the general good. Socialism is opposed to monopoly, that is, to
private ownership of land and the instruments of labor, which is
indirect ownership of men; to the wages system, by which labor is
legally robbed of a large part of the product of labor; to
competition with its enormous waste of effort and its
opportunities for the spoliation of the weak by the strong.
Socialism is industrial democracy. It is the government of the
people by the people and for the people, not in the present
restricted sense, but as regards all the common interests of men.
Socialism is opposed to oligarchy
<a class="pagebreak" name="page328" id="page328" title="328"></a>
and monarchy, and therefore to the tyrannies of business cliques
and money kings. Socialism is for freedom, not only from the fear
of force, but from the fear of want. Socialism proposes real
liberty, not merely the right to vote, but the liberty to live for
something more than meat and drink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Socialism is righteousness in the relations of men. It
is based on the fundamentals of religion, the Fatherhood of God
and the Brotherhood of men. It seeks through association and
equality to realize fraternity. Socialism will destroy the
motives which make for cheap manufacturers, poor workmanship and
adulterations; it will secure the real utility of things. Use, not
exchange, will be the object of labour. Things will be made to
serve, not to sell. Socialism will banish war, for private
ownership is back of strife between men. Socialism will purify
politics, for private capitalism is the great source of political
corruption. Socialism will make for education, invention and
discovery; it will stimulate the moral development of men. Crime
will have lost most of its motive and pauperism will have no
excuse. That,&rdquo; said Shirley, as she concluded, &ldquo;is
socialism!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder shrugged his shoulders and rose to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delightful,&rdquo; he said ironically, &ldquo;but in my
judgment wholly Utopian and impracticable. It's nothing
<a class="pagebreak" name="page329" id="page329" title="329"></a>
but a gigantic pipe dream. It won't come in this generation nor in
ten generations if, indeed, it is ever taken seriously by a
majority big enough to put its theories to the test. Socialism
does not take into account two great factors that move the
world&mdash;men's passions and human ambition. If you eliminate
ambition you remove the strongest incentive to individual effort.
From your own account a socialistic world would be a dreadfully
tame place to live in&mdash;everybody depressingly good, without
any of the feverish turmoil of life as we know it. Such a world
would not appeal to me at all. I love the fray&mdash;the daily
battle of gain and loss, the excitement of making or losing
millions. That is my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet what good is your money to you?&rdquo; insisted
Shirley. &ldquo;You are able to spend only an infinitesimal part
of it. You cannot even give it away, for nobody will have any of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; he hissed rather than spoke, &ldquo;I hate
money. It means nothing to me. I have so much that I have lost all
idea of its value. I go on accumulating it for only one purpose.
It buys power. I love power&mdash;that is my passion, my ambition,
to rule the world with my gold. Do you know,&rdquo; he went on and
leaning over the desk in a dramatic attitude, &ldquo;that if I
chose I could start a panic in Wall Street to-morrow
<a class="pagebreak" name="page330" id="page330" title="330"></a>
that would shake to their foundations every financial institution
in the country? Do you know that I practically control the
Congress of the United States and that no legislative measure
becomes law unless it has my approval?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The public has long suspected as much,&rdquo; replied
Shirley. &ldquo;That is why you are looked upon as a menace to the
stability and honesty of our political and commercial
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An angry answer rose to his lips when the door opened and Mrs.
Ryder entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've been looking for you, John,&rdquo; she said
peevishly. &ldquo;Mr. Bagley told me you were somewhere in the
house. Senator Roberts is downstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's come about Jefferson and his daughter, I
suppose,&rdquo; muttered Ryder. &ldquo;Well, I'll see him. Where
is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the library. Kate came with him. She's in my
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They left Shirley to her writing, and when he had closed the
door the financier turned to his wife and said impatiently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what are we going to do about Jefferson and Kate?
The senator insists on the matter of their marriage being settled
one way or another. Where is Jefferson?&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page331" id="page331" title="331"></a>
<p>&ldquo;He came in about half an hour ago. He was upstairs to
see me, and I thought he was looking for you,&rdquo; answered the
wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Ryder determinedly, &ldquo;he and I
have got to understand each other. This can't go on. It
shan't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryder put her hand on his arm, and said pleadingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be impatient with the boy, John. Remember he is
all we have. He is so unhappy. He wants to please us,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he insists on pleasing himself,&rdquo; said Ryder
completing the sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid, John, that his liking for that Miss Rossmore
is more serious than you realize&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The financier stamped his foot and replied angrily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Rossmore! That name seems to confront me at every
turn&mdash;for years the father, now the daughter! I'm sorry, my
dear,&rdquo; he went on more calmly, &ldquo;that you seem inclined
to listen to Jefferson. It only encourages him in his attitude
towards me. Kate would make him an excellent wife, while what do
we know about the other woman? Are you willing to sacrifice your
son's future to a mere boyish whim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryder sighed.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page332" id="page332" title="332"></a>
<p>&ldquo;It's very hard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for a mother to
know what to advise. Miss Green says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband, &ldquo;you have
consulted Miss Green on the subject?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered his wife, &ldquo;I don't know how I
came to tell her, but I did. I seem to tell her everything. I
find her such a comfort, John. I haven't had an attack of nerves
since that girl has been in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is certainly a superior woman,&rdquo; admitted
Ryder. &ldquo;I wish she'd ward that Rossmore girl off. I wish
she&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped abruptly as if not venturing to give
expression to his thoughts, even to his wife. Then he said:
&ldquo;If she were Kate Roberts she wouldn't let Jeff slip through
her fingers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have often wished,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Ryder,
&ldquo;that Kate were more like Shirley Green. I don't think we
would have any difficulty with Jeff then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate is the daughter of Senator Roberts, and if this
marriage is broken off in any way without the senator's consent,
he is in a position to injure my interests materially. If you see
Jefferson send him to me in the library. I'll go and keep Roberts
in good humour until he comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went downstairs and Mrs. Ryder proceeded to her apartments,
where she found Jefferson chatting
<a class="pagebreak" name="page333" id="page333" title="333"></a>
with Kate. She at once delivered Ryder Sr.'s message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeff, your father wants to see you in the
library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want to see him,&rdquo; answered the young man
grimly, and after a few moments more badinage with Kate he left
the room.</p>

<p>It was not a mere coincidence that had brought Senator Roberts
and his daughter and the financier's son all together under the
Ryder roof at the same time. It was part of Jefferson's
well-prepared plan to expose the rascality of his father's
secretary, and at the same time rid himself of the embarrassing
entanglement with Kate Roberts. If the senator were confronted
publicly with the fact that his daughter, while keeping up the
fiction of being engaged to Ryder Jr., was really preparing to run
off with the Hon. Fitzroy Bagley, he would have no alternative but
to retire gracefully under fire and relinquish all idea of a
marriage alliance with the house of Ryder. The critical moment
had arrived. To-morrow, Wednesday, was the day fixed for the
elopement. The secretary's little game had gone far enough. The
time had come for action. So Jefferson had written to Senator
Roberts, who was in Washington, asking him if it would be
convenient for him to come at once to New York and meet himself
and his father on a matter
<a class="pagebreak" name="page334" id="page334" title="334"></a>
of importance. The senator naturally jumped to the conclusion that
Jefferson and Ryder had reached an amicable understanding, and he
immediately hurried to New York and with his daughter came round
to Seventy-fourth Street.</p>

<p>When Ryder Sr. entered the library, Senator Roberts was
striding nervously up and down the room. This, he felt, was an
important day. The ambition of his life seemed on the point of
being attained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Roberts,&rdquo; was Ryder's cheerful greeting.
&ldquo;What's brought you from Washington at a critical time like
this? The Rossmore impeachment needs every friend we
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as if you didn't know,&rdquo; smiled the senator
uneasily, &ldquo;that I am here by appointment to meet you and
your son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To meet me and my son?&rdquo; echoed Ryder
astonished.</p>

<p>The senator, perplexed and beginning to feel real alarm, showed
the financier Jefferson's letter. Ryder read it and he looked
pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if the lad
asked you to meet us here it can mean only one thing&mdash;that at
last he has made up his mind to this marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's what I thought,&rdquo; replied the senator,
breathing more freely. &ldquo;I was sorry to leave Washington
<a class="pagebreak" name="page335" id="page335" title="335"></a>
at such a time, but I'm a father, and Kate is more to me than the
Rossmore impeachment. Besides, to see her married to your son
Jefferson is one of the dearest wishes of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can rest easy,&rdquo; said Ryder; &ldquo;that is
practically settled. Jefferson's sending for you proves that he is
now ready to meet my wishes. He'll be here any minute. How is the
Rossmore case progressing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so well as it might,&rdquo; growled the senator.
&ldquo;There's a lot of maudlin sympathy for the judge. He's a
pretty sick man by all accounts, and the newspapers seem to be
taking his part. One or two of the Western senators are talking
Corporate influence and Trust legislation, but when it comes to a
vote the matter will be settled on party lines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means that Judge Rossmore will be removed?&rdquo;
demanded Ryder sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, with five votes to spare,&rdquo; answered the
senator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's not enough,&rdquo; insisted Ryder. &ldquo;There
must be at least twenty. Let there be no blunders, Roberts. The
man is a menace to all the big commercial interests. This thing
must go through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door opened and Jefferson appeared. On seeing the senator
talking with his father, he hesitated on the threshold.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page336" id="page336" title="336"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Jeff,&rdquo; said his father pleasantly.
&ldquo;You expected to see Senator Roberts, didn't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. How do you do, Senator?&rdquo; said the young
man, advancing into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got your letter, my boy, and here I am,&rdquo; said
the senator smiling affably. &ldquo;I suppose we can guess what
the business is, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he's going to marry Kate, of course,&rdquo; chimed
in Ryder Sr. &ldquo;Jeff, my lad, I'm glad you are beginning to
see my way of looking at things. You're doing more to please me
lately, and I appreciate it. You stayed at home when I asked you
to, and now you've made up your mind regarding this
marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson let his father finish his speech, and then he said
calmly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there must be some misapprehension as to the
reason for my summoning Senator Roberts to New York. It had
nothing to do with my marrying Miss Roberts, but to prevent her
marriage with someone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Ryder, Sr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marriage with someone else?&rdquo; echoed the senator.
He thought he had not heard aright, yet at the same time he had
grave misgivings. &ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking from his pocket a copy of the letter he had
<a class="pagebreak" name="page337" id="page337" title="337"></a>
picked up on the staircase, Jefferson held it out to the girl's
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your daughter is preparing to run away with my father's
secretary. To-morrow would have been too late. That is why I
summoned you. Read this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senator took the letter, and as he read his face grew ashen
and his hand trembled violently. At one blow all his ambitious
projects for his daughter had been swept away. The inconsiderate
act of a silly, thoughtless girl had spoiled the carefully laid
plans of a lifetime. The only consolation which remained was that
the calamity might have been still more serious. This timely
warning had saved his family from perhaps an even greater scandal.
He passed the letter in silence to Ryder, Sr.</p>

<p>The financier was a man of few words when the situation called
for prompt action. After he had read the letter through, there was
an ominous silence. Then he rang a bell. The butler appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Mr. Bagley I want him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man bowed and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the devil is this Bagley?&rdquo; demanded the
senator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;English&mdash;blue blood&mdash;no money,&rdquo; was
Ryder's laconic answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's the only kind we seem to get over here,&rdquo;
<a class="pagebreak" name="page338" id="page338" title="338"></a>
growled the senator. &ldquo;We furnish the money&mdash;they
furnish the blood&mdash;damn his blue blood! I don't want any in
mine.&rdquo; Turning to Jefferson, he said: &ldquo;Jefferson,
whatever the motives that actuated you, I can only thank you for
this warning. I think it would have broken my heart if my girl had
gone away with that scoundrel. Of course, under the circumstances,
I must abandon all idea of your becoming my son-in-law. I release
you from all obligations you may have felt yourself bound
by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson bowed and remained silent.</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr. eyed his son closely, an amused expression hovering
on his face. After all, it was not so much he who had desired this
match as Roberts, and as long as the senator was willing to
withdraw, he could make no objection. He wondered what part, if
any, his son had played in bringing about this sensational
denouement to a match which had been so distasteful to him, and it
gratified his paternal vanity to think that Jefferson after all
might be smarter than he had given him credit for.</p>

<p>At this juncture Mr. Bagley entered the room. He was a little
taken aback on seeing the senator, but like most men of his class,
his self-conceit made him confident of his ability to handle any
emergency which might arise, and he had no reason to suspect that
this
<a class="pagebreak" name="page339" id="page339" title="339"></a>
hasty summons to the library had anything to do with his
matrimonial plans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ask for me, sir?&rdquo; he demanded, addressing
his employer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Bagley,&rdquo; replied Ryder, fixing the
secretary with a look that filled the latter with misgivings.
&ldquo;What steamers leave to-morrow for England?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Bagley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said to-morrow,&rdquo; repeated Ryder, slightly
raising his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; stammered the secretary, &ldquo;there
is the White Star, the North German Lloyd, the Atlantic
Transport&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any preference?&rdquo; inquired the
financier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, none at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you'll go on board one of the ships
to-night,&rdquo; said Ryder. &ldquo;Your things will be packed and
sent to you before the steamer sails to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Hon. Fitzroy Bagley, third son of a British peer, did not
understand even yet that he was discharged as one dismisses a
housemaid caught kissing the policeman. He could not think what
Mr. Ryder wanted him to go abroad for unless it were on some
matter of business, and it was decidedly inconvenient for him to
sail at this time.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page340" id="page340" title="340"></a>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I'm
afraid&mdash;I'm afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined Ryder promptly, &ldquo;I notice
that&mdash;your hand is shaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that you have other engagements!&rdquo; said
Ryder sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;no but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No engagement at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning?&rdquo;
insisted Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With my daughter?&rdquo; chimed in the senator.</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley now understood. He broke out in a cold perspiration
and he paled visibly. In the hope that the full extent of his
plans were not known, he attempted to brazen it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not, under no circumstances,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr. rang a bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she has an engagement with you. We'll ask
her.&rdquo; To the butler, who entered, he said: &ldquo;Tell Miss
Roberts that her father would like to see her here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man disappeared and the senator took a hand in
cross-examining the now thoroughly uncomfortable secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you thought my daughter looked pale and that
<a class="pagebreak" name="page341" id="page341" title="341"></a>
a little excursion to Buffalo would be a good thing for her? Well,
it won't be a good thing for you, young man, I can assure you of
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The English aristocrat began to wilt. His assurance of manner
quite deserted him and he stammered painfully as he floundered
about in excuses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not with me&mdash;oh dear, no,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never proposed to run away with my daughter?&rdquo;
cried the irate father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run away with her?&rdquo; stammered Bagley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And marry her?&rdquo; shouted the senator, shaking his
fist at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh say&mdash;this is hardly fair&mdash;three against
one&mdash;really&mdash;I'm awfully sorry, eh, what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door opened and Kate Roberts bounced in. She was smiling
and full of animal spirits, but on seeing the stern face of her
father and the pitiable picture presented by her faithful Fitz she
was intelligent enough to immediately scent danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you want to see me, father?&rdquo; she inquired
boldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Kate,&rdquo; answered the senator gravely,
&ldquo;we have just been having a talk with Mr. Bagley, in which
you were one of the subjects of conversation. Can you guess what
it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl looked from her father to Bagley and from
<a class="pagebreak" name="page342" id="page342" title="342"></a>
him to the Ryders. Her aristocratic lover made a movement forward
as if to exculpate himself, but he caught Ryder's eye and remained
where he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, with a nervous laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true&rdquo; asked the senator, &ldquo;that you
were about to marry this man secretly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cast down her eyes and answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to add?&rdquo; asked her father
sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kate shaking her head. &ldquo;It's true.
We intended to run away, didn't we Fitz?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind about Mr. Bagley,&rdquo; thundered her
father. &ldquo;Haven't you a word of shame for this disgrace you
have brought upon me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh papa, don't be so cross. Jefferson did not care for
me. I couldn't be an old maid. Mr. Bagley has a lovely castle in
England, and one day he'll sit in the House of Lords. He'll
explain everything to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll explain nothing,&rdquo; rejoined the senator
grimly. &ldquo;Mr. Bagley returns to England to-night. He won't
have time to explain anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Returns to England?&rdquo; echoed Kate dismayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you go with me to Washington at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senator turned to Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye Ryder. The little domestic comedy is
<a class="pagebreak" name="page343" id="page343" title="343"></a>
ended. I'm grateful it didn't turn out a drama. The next time I
pick out a son-in-law I hope I'll have better luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook hands with Jefferson, and left the room followed by
his crestfallen daughter.</p>

<p>Ryder, who had gone to write something at his desk, strode over
to where Mr. Bagley was standing and handed him a cheque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, sir, this settles everything to date.
Good-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; stammered the secretary
helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder turned his back on him and conversed with, his son, while
Mr. Bagley slowly, and as if regretfully, made his exit.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page344" id="page344" title="344"></a>
<a name="chapter15" id="chapter15"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>It was now December and the Senate had been in session for over
a week. Jefferson had not forgotten his promise, and one day,
about two weeks after Mr. Bagley's spectacular dismissal from the
Ryder residence, he had brought Shirley the two letters. She did
not ask him how he got them, if he forced the drawer or procured
the key. It sufficed for her that the precious letters&mdash;the
absolute proof of her father's innocence&mdash;were at last in her
possession. She at once sent them off by registered mail to
Stott, who immediately acknowledged receipt and at the same time
announced his departure for Washington that night. He promised to
keep her constantly informed of what he was doing and how her
father's case was going. It could, he thought, be only a matter of
a few days now before the result of the proceedings would be
known.</p>

<p>The approach of the crisis made Shirley exceedingly nervous,
and it was only by the exercise of the greatest self-control that
she did not betray the terrible anxiety she felt. The Ryder
biography was nearly finished
<a class="pagebreak" name="page345" id="page345" title="345"></a>
and her stay in Seventy-fourth Street would soon come to an end.
She had a serious talk with Jefferson, who contrived to see a good
deal of her, entirely unsuspected by his parents, for Mr. and Mrs.
Ryder had no reason to believe that their son had any more than a
mere bowing acquaintance with the clever young authoress. Now that
Mr. Bagley was no longer there to spy upon their actions these
clandestine interviews had been comparatively easy. Shirley
brought to bear all the arguments she could think of to convince
Jefferson of the hopelessness of their engagement. She insisted
that she could never be his wife; circumstances over which they
had no control made that dream impossible. It were better, she
said, to part now rather than incur the risk of being unhappy
later. But Jefferson refused to be convinced. He argued and
pleaded and he even swore&mdash;strange, desperate words that
Shirley had never heard before and which alarmed her not a
little&mdash;and the discussion ended usually by a kiss which put
Shirley completely <i>hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>Meantime, John Ryder had not ceased worrying about his son. The
removal of Kate Roberts as a factor in his future had not
eliminated the danger of Jefferson taking the bit between his
teeth one day and contracting a secret marriage with the daughter
<a class="pagebreak" name="page346" id="page346" title="346"></a>
of his enemy, and when he thought of the mere possibility of such
a thing happening he stormed and raved until his wife, accustomed
as she was to his choleric outbursts, was thoroughly frightened.
For some time after Bagley's departure, father and son got along
together fairly amicably, but Ryder, Sr. was quick to see that
Jefferson had something on his mind which was worrying him, and he
rightly attributed it to his infatuation for Miss Rossmore. He was
convinced that his son knew where the judge's daughter was,
although his own efforts to discover her whereabouts had been
unsuccessful. Sergeant Ellison had confessed absolute failure;
Miss Rossmore, he reported, had disappeared as completely as if
the earth had swallowed her, and further search was futile.
Knowing well his son's impulsive, headstrong disposition, Ryder,
Sr. believed him quite capable of marrying the girl secretly any
time. The only thing that John Ryder did not know was that Shirley
Rossmore was not the kind of a girl to allow any man to inveigle
her into a secret marriage. The Colossus, who judged the world's
morals by his own, was not of course aware of this, and he worried
night and day thinking what he could do to prevent his son from
marrying the daughter of the man he had wronged.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page347" id="page347" title="347"></a>
<p>The more he pondered over it, the more he regretted that there
was not some other girl with whom Jefferson could fall in love and
marry. He need not seek a rich girl&mdash;there was certainly
enough money in the Ryder family to provide for both. He wished
they knew a girl, for example, as attractive and clever as Miss
Green. Ah! he thought, there was a girl who would make a man of
Jefferson&mdash;brainy, ambitious, active! And the more he thought
of it the more the idea grew on him that Miss Green would be an
ideal daughter-in-law, and at the same time snatch his son from
the clutches of the Rossmore woman.</p>

<p>Jefferson, during all these weeks, was growing more and more
impatient. He knew that any day now Shirley might take her
departure from their house and return to Massapequa. If the
impeachment proceedings went against her father it was more than
likely that he would lose her forever, and if, on the contrary,
the judge were acquitted, Shirley never would be willing to marry
him without his father's consent; and this, he felt, he would
never obtain. He resolved, therefore, to have a final interview
with his father and declare boldly his intention of making Miss
Rossmore his wife, regardless of the consequences.</p>

<p>The opportunity came one evening after dinner.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page348" id="page348" title="348"></a>
Ryder, Sr. was sitting alone in the library, reading, Mrs. Ryder
had gone to the theatre with a friend, Shirley as usual was
writing in her room, giving the final touches to her now completed
&ldquo;History of the Empire Trading Company.&rdquo; Jefferson
took the bull by the horns and boldly accosted his redoubtable
parent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I have a few minutes of your time,
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr. laid aside the paper he was reading and looked up.
It was unusual for his son to come to him on any errand, and he
liked to encourage it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Jefferson. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to appeal to you, sir. I want you to use your
influence, before it is too late, to save Judge Rossmore. A word
from you at this time would do wonders in Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The financier swung half-round in his chair, the smile of
greeting faded out of his face, and his voice was hard as he
replied coldly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again? I thought we had agreed not to discuss Judge
Rossmore any further?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't help it, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Jefferson
undeterred by his sire's hostile attitude, &ldquo;that poor old
man is practically on trial for his life. He is as innocent of
wrongdoing as a child unborn, and you know it. You could save him
if you would.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page349" id="page349" title="349"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Jefferson,&rdquo; answered Ryder, Sr., biting his lip to
restrain his impatience, &ldquo;I told you before that I could not
interfere even if I would; and I won't, because that man is my
enemy. Important business interests, which you cannot possibly
know anything about, demand his dismissal from the
bench.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely your business interests don't demand the
sacrifice of a man's life!&rdquo; retorted Jefferson. &ldquo;I
know modern business methods are none too squeamish, but I should
think you'd draw the line at deliberate murder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder sprang to his feet and for a moment stood glaring at the
young man. His lips moved, but no sound came from them. Suppressed
wrath rendered him speechless. What was the world coming to when a
son could talk to his father in this manner?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you presume to judge my actions or to criticise
my methods?&rdquo; he burst out; finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You force me to do so,&rdquo; answered Jefferson hotly.
<a name="typo4" id="typo4"></a>
&ldquo;I want to tell you that I am heartily ashamed of this whole
affair and your connection with it, and since you refuse to make
reparation in the only way possible for the wrong you and your
associates have done Judge Rossmore&mdash;that is by saving him in
the Senate&mdash;I think it only fair to warn you that I take back
my word in regard to not marrying without
<a class="pagebreak" name="page350" id="page350" title="350"></a>
your consent. I want you to know that I intend to marry Miss
Rossmore as soon as she will consent to become my wife, that
is,&rdquo; he added with bitterness, &ldquo;if I can succeed in
overcoming her prejudices against my family&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr. laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prejudices against a thousand million dollars?&rdquo; he
exclaimed sceptically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jefferson decisively,
&ldquo;prejudices against our family, against you and your
business practices. Money is not everything. One day you will find
that out. I tell you definitely that I intend to make Miss
Rossmore my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr. made no reply, and as Jefferson had expected an
explosion, this unnatural calm rather startled him. He was sorry
he had spoken so harshly. It was his father, after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've forced me to defy you, father,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;I'm sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, Sr. shrugged his shoulders and resumed his seat. He lit
another cigar, and with affected carelessness he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Jeff, my boy, we'll let it go at that You're
sorry&mdash;so am I. You've shown me your cards&mdash;I'll show
you mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His composed unruffled manner vanished. He
<a class="pagebreak" name="page351" id="page351" title="351"></a>
suddenly threw off the mask and revealed the tempest that was
raging within. He leaned across the desk, his face convulsed with
uncontrollable passion, a terrifying picture of human wrath.
Shaking his fist at his son he shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I get through with Judge Rossmore at Washington,
I'll start after his daughter. This time to-morrow he'll be a
disgraced man. A week later she will be a notorious woman. Then
we'll see if you'll be so eager to marry her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is sure to be something in her life that won't
bear inspection,&rdquo; sneered Ryder. &ldquo;There is in
everybody's life. I'll find out what it is. Where is she to-day?
She can't be found. No one knows where she is&mdash;not even her
own mother. Something is wrong&mdash;the girl's no
good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson started forward as if to resent these insults to the
woman he loved, but, realizing that it was his own father, he
stopped short and his hands fell powerless at his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, is that all?&rdquo; inquired Ryder, Sr. with a
sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's all,&rdquo; replied Jefferson, &ldquo;I'm going.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page352" id="page352" title="352"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; answered his father indifferently;
&ldquo;leave your address with your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson left the room, and Ryder, Sr., as if exhausted by the
violence of his own outburst, sank back limp in his chair. The
crisis he dreaded had come at last. His son had openly defied his
authority and was going to marry the daughter of his enemy. He
must do something to prevent it; the marriage must not take place,
but what could he do? The boy was of age and legally his own
master. He could do nothing to restrain his actions unless they
put him in an insane asylum. He would rather see his son there, he
mused, than married to the Rossmore woman.</p>

<p>Presently there was a timid knock at the library door. Ryder
rose from his seat and went to see who was there. To his surprise
it was Miss Green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; asked Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, by all means. Sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew up a chair for her, and his manner was so cordial that
it was easy to see she was a welcome visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ryder,&rdquo; she began in a low, tremulous voice,
&ldquo;I have come to see you on a very important matter. I've
been waiting to see you all evening&mdash;and as I shall be here
only a short time longer I&mdash;want to ask you a great
favour&mdash;perhaps the greatest you were ever
<a class="pagebreak" name="page353" id="page353" title="353"></a>
asked&mdash;I want to ask you for mercy&mdash;for mercy
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped and glanced nervously at him, but she saw he was
paying no attention to what she was saying. He was puffing heavily
at his cigar, entirely preoccupied with his own thoughts. Her
sudden silence aroused him. He apologized:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, excuse me&mdash;I didn't quite catch what you were
saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said nothing, wondering what had happened to render him so
absent-minded. He read the question in her face, for, turning
towards her, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the first time in my life I am face to face with
defeat&mdash;defeat of the most ignominious
kind&mdash;incapacity&mdash;inability to regulate my own internal
affairs. I can rule a government, but I can't manage my own
family&mdash;my own son. I'm a failure. Tell me,&rdquo; he added,
appealing to her, &ldquo;why can't I rule my own household, why
can't I govern my own child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can't you govern yourself?&rdquo; said Shirley
quietly.</p>

<p>Ryder looked keenly at her for a moment without answering her
question; then, as if prompted by a sudden inspiration, he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can help me, but not by preaching at me. This is
the first time in my life I ever called on a
<a class="pagebreak" name="page354" id="page354" title="354"></a>
living soul for help. I'm only accustomed to deal with men. This
time there's a woman in the case&mdash;and I need your woman's
wit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I help you?&rdquo; asked Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he answered with suppressed
excitement. &ldquo;As I told you, I am up against a blank wall. I
can't see my way.&rdquo; He gave a nervous little laugh and went
on: &ldquo;God! I'm ashamed of myself&mdash;ashamed! Did you ever
read the fable of the Lion and the Mouse? Well, I want you to gnaw
with your sharp woman's teeth at the cords which bind the son of
John Burkett Ryder to this Rossmore woman. I want you to be the
mouse&mdash;to set me free of this disgraceful
entanglement.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="insquote7" id="insquote7"></a>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Shirley calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that's just it&mdash;how?&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Can't you think&mdash;you're a woman&mdash;you have youth,
beauty&mdash;brains.&rdquo; He stopped and eyed her closely until
she reddened from the embarrassing scrutiny. Then he blurted out:
&ldquo;By George! marry him yourself&mdash;force him to let go of
this other woman! Why not? Come, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This unexpected suggestion came upon Shirley with all the force
of a violent shock. She immediately saw the falseness of her
position. This man was asking for her hand for his son under the
impression that
<a class="pagebreak" name="page355" id="page355" title="355"></a>
she was another woman. It would be dishonorable of her to keep up
the deception any longer. She passed her hand over her face to
conceal her confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you must give me time to think,&rdquo; she
stammered. &ldquo;Suppose I don't love your son&mdash;I should
want something&mdash;something to compensate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something to compensate?&rdquo; echoed Ryder surprised
and a little disconcerted. &ldquo;Why, the boy will inherit
millions&mdash;I don't know how many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, not money,&rdquo; rejoined Shirley;
&ldquo;money only compensates those who love money. It's something
else&mdash;a man's honour&mdash;a man's life! It means nothing to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gazed at her, not understanding. Full of his own project, he
had mind for nothing else. Ignoring therefore the question of
compensation, whatever she might mean by that, he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can win him if you make up your mind to. A woman
with your resources can blind him to any other woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if&mdash;he loves Judge Rossmore's daughter?&rdquo;
objected Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's for you to make him forget her&mdash;and you
can,&rdquo; replied the financier confidently. &ldquo;My desire is
to separate him from this Rossmore woman at any
<a class="pagebreak" name="page356" id="page356" title="356"></a>
cost. You must help me.&rdquo; His sternness relaxed somewhat and
his eyes rested on her kindly. &ldquo;Do you know, I should be
glad to think you won't have to leave us. Mrs. Ryder has taken a
fancy to you, and I myself shall miss you when you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask me to be your son's wife and you know nothing of
my family,&rdquo; said Shirley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you&mdash;that is sufficient,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no you don't,&rdquo; returned Shirley,
&ldquo;nor do you know your son. He has more constancy&mdash;more
strength of character than you think&mdash;and far more principle
than you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much the greater the victory for you,&rdquo; he
answered good humouredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said reproachfully, &ldquo;you do not
love your son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do love him,&rdquo; replied Ryder warmly. &ldquo;It's
because I love him that I'm such a fool in this matter. Don't you
see that if he marries this girl it would separate us, and I
should lose him. I don't want to lose him. If I welcomed her to my
house it would make me the laughing-stock of all my friends and
business associates. Come, will you join forces with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley shook her head and was about to reply when
<a class="pagebreak" name="page357" id="page357" title="357"></a>
the telephone bell rang. Ryder took up the receiver and spoke to
the butler downstairs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who's that? Judge Stott? Tell him I'm too busy to see
anyone. What's that? A man's life at stake? What's that to do with
me? Tell him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On hearing Stott's name, Shirley nearly betrayed herself. She
turned pale and half-started up from her chair. Something serious
must have happened to bring her father's legal adviser to the
Ryder residence at such an hour! She thought he was in Washington.
Could it be that the proceedings in the Senate were ended and the
result known? She could hardly conceal her anxiety, and
instinctively she placed her hand on Ryder's arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Ryder, do see Judge Stott! You must see him. I
know who he is. Your son has told me. Judge Stott is one of Judge
Rossmore's advisers. See him. You may find out something about
the girl. You may find out where she is. If Jefferson finds out
you have refused to see her father's friend at such a critical
time it will only make him sympathize more deeply with the
Rossmores, and you know sympathy is akin to love. That's what you
want to avoid, isn't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder still held the telephone, hesitating what to do. What she
said sounded like good sense.</p>

<a name="insquote8" id="insquote8"></a>
<a class="pagebreak" name="page358" id="page358" title="358"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word&mdash;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may be
right and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to help you or not?&rdquo; demanded Shirley.
&ldquo;You said you wanted a woman's wit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ryder, &ldquo;but
still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you had better see him,&rdquo; she said
emphatically.</p>

<p>Ryder turned to the telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jorkins, are you there? Show Judge Stott up
here.&rdquo; He laid the receiver down and turned again to
Shirley. &ldquo;That's one thing I don't like about you,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I allow you to decide against me and then I agree
with you.&rdquo; She said nothing and he went on looking at her
admiringly. &ldquo;I predict that you'll bring that boy to your
feet within a month. I don't know why, but I seem to feel that he
is attracted to you already. Thank Heaven! you haven't a lot of
troublesome relations. I think you said you were almost alone in
the world. Don't look so serious,&rdquo; he added laughing.
&ldquo;Jeff is a fine fellow, and believe me an excellent catch as
the world goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley raised her hand as if entreating him to desist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't&mdash;don't&mdash;please! My position is so
false! You don't know how false it is!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>At that instant the library door was thrown open
<a class="pagebreak" name="page359" id="page359" title="359"></a>
and the butler appeared, ushering in Stott. The lawyer looked
anxious, and his dishevelled appearance indicated that he had come
direct from the train. Shirley scanned his face narrowly in the
hope that she might read there what had happened. He walked right
past her, giving no sign of recognition, and advanced direct
towards Ryder, who had risen and remained standing at his
desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had better go?&rdquo; ventured Shirley,
although tortured by anxiety to hear the news from Washington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ryder quickly, &ldquo;Judge Stott will
detain me but a very few moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this delicate hint, he looked
towards his visitor as if inviting him to come to the point as
rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must apologize for intruding at this unseemly hour,
sir,&rdquo; said Stott, &ldquo;but time is precious. The Senate
meets to-morrow to vote. If anything is to be done for Judge
Rossmore it must be done to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fail to see why you address yourself to me in this
matter, sir,&rdquo; replied Ryder with asperity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Judge Rossmore's friend and counsel,&rdquo; answered
Stott, &ldquo;I am impelled to ask your help at this critical
moment.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page360" id="page360" title="360"></a>
<p>&ldquo;The matter is in the hands of the United States Senate,
sir,&rdquo; replied Ryder coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are against him!&rdquo; cried Stott; &ldquo;not one
senator I've spoken to holds out any hope for him. If he is
convicted it will mean his death. Inch by inch his life is leaving
him. The only thing that can save him is the good news of the
Senate's refusal to find him guilty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stott was talking so excitedly and loudly that neither he nor
Ryder heard the low moan that came from the corner of the room
where Shirley was standing listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do nothing,&rdquo; repeated Ryder coldly, and he
turned his back and began to examine some papers lying on his desk
as if to notify the caller that the interview was ended. But Stott
was not so easily discouraged. He went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I understand it, they will vote on strictly party
lines, and the party in power is against him. He's a marked man.
You have the power to help him.&rdquo; Heedless of Ryder's gesture
of impatience he continued: &ldquo;When I left his bedside
to-night, sir, I promised to return to him with good news; I have
told him that the Senate ridicules the charges against him. I must
return to him with good news. He is very ill to-night, sir.&rdquo;
He halted for a moment and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page361" id="page361" title="361"></a>
glanced in Shirley's direction, and slightly raising his voice so
she might hear, he added: &ldquo;If he gets worse we shall send
for his daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is his daughter?&rdquo; demanded Ryder, suddenly
interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is working in her father's interests,&rdquo; replied
Stott, and, he added significantly, &ldquo;I believe with some
hope of success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave Shirley a quick, questioning look. She nodded
affirmatively. Ryder, who had seen nothing of this by-play, said
with a sneer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you didn't come here to-night to tell me
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I did not.&rdquo; He took from his pocket two
letters&mdash;the two which Shirley had sent him&mdash;and held
them out for Ryder's inspection. &ldquo;These letters from Judge
Rossmore to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;show you to be acquainted
with the fact that he bought those shares as an
investment&mdash;and did not receive them as a bribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he caught sight of the letters and he realized what they
were, Ryder changed colour. Instinctively his eyes sought the
drawer on the left-hand side of his desk. In a voice that was
unnaturally calm, he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you produce them before the Senate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was too late,&rdquo; explained Stott, handing them to
<a class="pagebreak" name="page362" id="page362" title="362"></a>
the financier. &ldquo;I received them only two days ago. But if
you come forward and declare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder made an effort to control himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll do nothing of the kind. I refuse to move in the
matter. That is final. And now, sir,&rdquo; he added, raising his
voice and pointing to the letters, &ldquo;I wish to know how comes
it that you had in your possession private correspondence
addressed to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I cannot answer,&rdquo; replied Stott promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From whom did you receive these letters?&rdquo; demanded
Ryder.</p>

<p>Stott was dumb, while Shirley clutched at her chair as if she
would fall. The financier repeated the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must decline to answer,&rdquo; replied Stott
finally.</p>

<p>Shirley left her place and came slowly forward. Addressing
Ryder, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to make a statement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The financier gazed at her in astonishment. What could she know
about it, he wondered, and he waited with curiosity to hear what
she was going to say. But Stott instantly realized that she was
about to take the blame upon herself, regardless of the
consequences to the success of their cause. This must be prevented
at all hazards, even if another must be sacrificed, so
interrupting her he said hastily to Ryder:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page363" id="page363" title="363"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Judge Rossmore's life and honour are at stake and no
false sense of delicacy must cause the failure of my object to
save him. These letters were sent to me by&mdash;your
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From my son!&rdquo; exclaimed Ryder, starting. For a
moment he staggered as if he had received a blow; he was too much
overcome to speak or act. Then recovering himself, he rang a bell,
and turned to Stott with renewed fury:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;this man, this judge whose
honour is at stake and his daughter, who most likely has no honour
at stake, between them have made a thief and a liar of my son!
false to his father, false to his party; and you, sir, have the
presumption to come here and ask me to intercede for him!&rdquo;
To the butler, who entered, he said: &ldquo;See if Mr. Jefferson
is still in the house. If he is, tell him I would like to see him
here at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man disappeared, and Ryder strode angrily up and down the
room with the letters in his hand. Then, turning abruptly on
Stott, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, sir, I think nothing more remains to be said. I
shall keep these letters, as they are my property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please. Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; replied Ryder, not looking up.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page364" id="page364" title="364"></a>
<p>With a significant glance at Shirley, who motioned to him that
she might yet succeed where he had failed, Stott left the room.
Ryder turned to Shirley. His fierceness of manner softened down as
he addressed the girl:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see what they have done to my son&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Shirley, &ldquo;it's the girl's
fault. If Jefferson hadn't loved her you would have helped the
judge. Ah, why did they ever meet! She has worked on his sympathy
and he&mdash;he took these letters for her sake, not to injure
you. Oh, you must make some allowance for him! One's sympathy gets
aroused in spite of oneself; even I feel sorry for&mdash;these
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; replied Ryder grimly, &ldquo;sympathy is
often weakness. Ah, there you are!&rdquo; turning to Jefferson,
who entered the room at that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent for me, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ryder, Sr., holding up the letters.
&ldquo;Have you ever seen these letters before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson took the letters and examined them, then he passed
them back to his father and said frankly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I took them out of your desk and sent them to Mr.
Stott in the hope they would help Judge Rossmore's
case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder restrained himself from proceeding to actual
<a class="pagebreak" name="page365" id="page365" title="365"></a>
violence only with the greatest difficulty. His face grew white as
death, his lips were compressed, his hands twitched convulsively,
his eyes flashed dangerously. He took another cigar to give the
impression that he had himself well under control, but the violent
trembling of his hands as he lit it betrayed the terrific strain
he was under.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you deliberately sacrificed
my interests to save this woman's father&mdash;you hear him, Miss
Green? Jefferson, my boy, I think it's time you and I had a final
accounting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley made a motion as if about to withdraw. He stopped her
with a gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don't go, Miss Green. As the writer of my
biography you are sufficiently well acquainted with my family
affairs to warrant your being present at the epilogue. Besides, I
want an excuse for keeping my temper. Sit down, Miss
Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning to Jefferson, he went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For your mother's sake, my boy, I have overlooked your
little eccentricities of character. But now we have arrived at the
parting of the ways&mdash;you have gone too far. The one aspect of
this business I cannot overlook is your willingness to sell, your
own father for the sake of a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own father,&rdquo; interrupted Jefferson bitterly,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page366" id="page366" title="366"></a>
&ldquo;would not hesitate to sell me if his business and political
interests warranted the sacrifice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley attempted the rôle of peacemaker. Appealing to the
younger man, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don't talk like that, Mr. Jefferson.&rdquo; Then
she turned to Ryder, Sr.: &ldquo;I don't think your son quite
understands you, Mr. Ryder, and, if you will pardon me, I don't
think you quite understand him. Do you realize that there is a
man's life at stake&mdash;that Judge Rossmore is almost at the
point of death and that favourable news from the Senate to-morrow
is perhaps the only thing that can save him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; sneered Ryder, Sr. &ldquo;Judge
Stott's story has aroused your sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I confess my sympathy is aroused. I do feel
for this father whose life is slowly ebbing away&mdash;whose
strength is being sapped hourly by the thought of the
disgrace&mdash;the injustice that is being done him! I do feel
for the wife of this suffering man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, its a complete picture!&rdquo; cried Ryder
mockingly.
<a name="insquote3" id="insquote3"></a>
&ldquo;The dying father, the sorrowing mother&mdash;and the
daughter, what is she supposed to be doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is fighting for her father's life,&rdquo; cried
Shirley, &ldquo;and you, Mr. Jefferson, should have
pleaded&mdash;pleaded&mdash;not demanded. It's no use trying to
combat your father's will.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page367" id="page367" title="367"></a>
<p>&ldquo;She is quite right, father. I should have implored you.
I do so now. I ask you for God's sake to help us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder was grim and silent. He rose from his seat and paced the
room, puffing savagely at his cigar. Then he turned and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;His removal is a political necessity. If he goes back on
the bench every paltry justice of the peace, every petty official
will think he has a special mission to tear down the structure
that hard work and capital have erected. No, this man has been
especially conspicuous in his efforts to block the progress of
amalgamated interests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so he must be sacrificed?&rdquo; cried Shirley
indignantly.</p>

<a name="insquote4" id="insquote4"></a>
<p>&ldquo;He is a meddlesome man,&rdquo; insisted Ryder
&ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is innocent of the charges brought against
him,&rdquo; urged Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ryder is not considering that point,&rdquo; said
Shirley bitterly. &ldquo;All he can see is that it is necessary to
put this poor old man in the public pillory, to set him up as a
warning to others of his class not to act in accordance with the
principles of Truth and Justice&mdash;not to dare to obstruct the
car of Juggernaut set in motion by the money gods of the
country!&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page368" id="page368" title="368"></a>
<p>&ldquo;It's the survival of the fittest, my dear,&rdquo; said
Ryder coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Shirley, making a last appeal to the
financier's heart of stone, &ldquo;use your great influence with
this governing body for good, not evil! Urge them to vote not in
accordance with party policy and personal interest, but in
accordance with their consciences&mdash;in accordance with Truth
and Justice! Ah, for God's sake, Mr. Ryder! don't permit this foul
injustice to blot the name of the highest tribunal in the Western
world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder laughed cynically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! Jefferson, I give you credit for having secured
an eloquent advocate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; went on Shirley, ignoring his taunting
comments, &ldquo;suppose this daughter promises that she will
never&mdash;never see your son again&mdash;that she will go away
to some foreign country!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; burst in Jefferson, &ldquo;why should she? If
my father is not man enough to do a simple act of justice without
bartering a woman's happiness and his son's happiness, let him
find comfort in his self-justification!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley, completely unnerved, made a move towards the door,
unable longer to bear the strain she was under. She tottered as
though she would fall. Ryder
<a class="pagebreak" name="page369" id="page369" title="369"></a>
made a quick movement towards his son and took him by the arm.
Pointing to Shirley he said in a low tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see how that girl pleads your cause for you! She
loves you, my boy!&rdquo; Jefferson started. &ldquo;Yes, she
does,&rdquo; pursued Ryder, Sr. &ldquo;She's worth a thousand of
the Rossmore woman. Make her your wife and I'll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make her my wife!&rdquo; cried Jefferson joyously. He
stared at his parent as if he thought he had suddenly been bereft
of his senses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make her my wife?&rdquo; he repeated incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you say?&rdquo; demanded Ryder, Sr.</p>

<p>The young man advanced towards Shirley, hands outstretched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Shir&mdash;Miss Green, will you?&rdquo; Seeing
that Shirley made no sign, he said: &ldquo;Not now, father; I will
speak to her later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, to-night, at once!&rdquo; insisted Ryder.
Addressing Shirley, he went on: &ldquo;Miss Green, my son is much
affected by your disinterested appeal in his behalf.
He&mdash;he&mdash;you can save him from himself&mdash;my son
wishes you&mdash;he asks you to become his wife! Is it not so,
Jefferson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, my wife!&rdquo; advancing again towards
Shirley.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page370" id="page370" title="370"></a>
<p>The girl shrank back in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, Mr. Ryder, I cannot, I cannot!&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Ryder, Sr. appealingly.
&ldquo;Ah, don't&mdash;don't decide hastily&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley, her face set and drawn and keen mental distress
showing in every line of it, faced the two men, pale and
determined. The time had come to reveal the truth. This masquerade
could go on no longer. It was not honourable either to her father
or to herself. Her self-respect demanded that she inform the
financier of her true identity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot marry your son with these lies upon my
lips!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I cannot go on with this deception.
I told you you did not know who I was, who my people were. My
story about them, my name, everything about me is false, every
word I have uttered is a lie, a fraud, a cheat! I would not tell
you now, but you trusted me and are willing to entrust your son's
future, your family honour in my keeping, and I can't keep back
the truth from you. Mr. Ryder, I am the daughter of the man you
hate. I am the woman your son loves. I am Shirley
Rossmore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder took his cigar from his lips and rose slowly to his
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You? You?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page371" id="page371" title="371"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I am the Rossmore woman! Listen, Mr.
Ryder. Don't turn away from me. Go to Washington on behalf of my
father, and I promise you I will never see your son
again&mdash;never, never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Shirley!&rdquo; cried Jefferson, &ldquo;you don't
love me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jeff, I do; God knows I do! But if I must break my
own heart to save my father I will do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you sacrifice my happiness and your
own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No happiness can be built on lies, Jeff. We must build
on truth or our whole house will crumble and fall. We have
deceived your father, but he will forgive that, won't you?&rdquo;
she said, appealing to Ryder, &ldquo;and you will go to
Washington, you will save my father's honour, his life, you
will&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood face to face&mdash;this slim, delicate girl battling
for her father's life, arrayed against a cold-blooded, heartless,
unscrupulous man, deaf to every impulse of human sympathy or pity.
Since this woman had deceived him, fooled him, he would deal with
her as with everyone else who crossed his will. She laid her hand
on his arm, pleading with him. Brutally, savagely, he thrust her
aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, I will not!&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;You have
wormed yourself into my confidence by means of lies
<a class="pagebreak" name="page372" id="page372" title="372"></a>
and deceit. You have tricked me, fooled me to the very limit! Oh,
it is easy to see how you have beguiled my son into the folly of
loving you! And you&mdash;you have the brazen effrontery to ask me
to plead for your father? No! No! No! Let the law take its course,
and now Miss Rossmore&mdash;you will please leave my house
to-morrow morning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley stood listening to what he had to say, her face white,
her mouth quivering. At last the crisis had come. It was a fight
to the finish between this man, the incarnation of corporate greed
and herself, representing the fundamental principles of right and
justice. She turned on him in a fury:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will leave your house to-night! Do you think I
would remain another hour beneath the roof of a man who is as
blind to justice, as deaf to mercy, as incapable of human sympathy
as you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her voice; and as she stood there denouncing the man
of money, her eyes flashing and her head thrown back, she looked
like some avenging angel defying one of the powers of Evil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo; shouted Ryder, beside himself,
and pointing to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Jefferson, starting forward to
protect the girl he loved.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page373" id="page373" title="373"></a>
<p>&ldquo;You have tricked him as you have me!&rdquo; thundered
Ryder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your own vanity that has tricked you!&rdquo; cried
Shirley contemptuously. &ldquo;You lay traps for yourself and walk
into them. You compel everyone around you to lie to you, to cajole
you, to praise you, to deceive you! At least, you cannot accuse me
of flattering you. I have never fawned upon you as you compel your
family and your friends and your dependents to do. I have always
appealed to your better nature by telling you the truth, and in
your heart you know that I am speaking the truth now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, let us go, Shirley!&rdquo; said Jefferson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jeff, I came here alone and I'm going
alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not. I shall go with you. I intend to make you
my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Shirley. &ldquo;Do you think I'd marry
a man whose father is as deep a discredit to the human race as
your father is? No, I wouldn't marry the son of such a merciless
tyrant! He refuses to lift his voice to save my father. I refuse
to marry his son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned on Ryder with all the fury of a tiger:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think if you lived in the olden days you'd be a
C&aelig;sar or an Alexander. But you wouldn't! You'd
<a class="pagebreak" name="page374" id="page374" title="374"></a>
be a Nero&mdash;a Nero! Sink my self-respect to the extent of
marrying into your family!&rdquo; she exclaimed contemptuously.
&ldquo;Never! I am going to Washington without your aid. I am
going to save my father if I have to go on my knees to every
United States Senator. I'll go to the White House; I'll tell the
President what you are! Marry your son&mdash;no, thank you! No,
thank you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Exhausted by the vehemence of her passionate outburst, Shirley
hurried from the room, leaving Ryder speechless, staring at his
son.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page375" id="page375" title="375"></a>
<a name="chapter16" id="chapter16"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>When Shirley reached her rooms she broke down completely, she
threw herself upon a sofa and burst into a fit of violent sobbing.
After all, she was only a woman and the ordeal through which she
had passed would have taxed the strongest powers of endurance. She
had borne up courageously while there remained the faintest chance
that she might succeed in moving the financier to pity, but now
that all hopes in that direction were shattered and she herself
had been ordered harshly from the house like any ordinary
malefactor, the reaction set in, and she gave way freely to her
long pent-up anguish and distress. Nothing now could save her
father&mdash;not even this journey to Washington which she
determined to take nevertheless, for, according to what Stott had
said, the Senate was to take a vote that very night.</p>

<p>She looked at the time&mdash;eleven o'clock. She had told Mr.
Ryder that she would leave his house at once, but on reflection it
was impossible for a girl alone to seek a room at that hour. It
would be midnight
<a class="pagebreak" name="page376" id="page376" title="376"></a>
before she could get her things packed. No, she would stay under
this hated roof until morning and then take the first train to
Washington. There was still a chance that the vote might be
delayed, in which case she might yet succeed in winning over some
of the senators. She began to gather her things together and was
thus engaged when she, heard a knock at her door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; she called out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's I,&rdquo; replied a familiar voice.</p>

<p>Shirley went to the door and opening it found Jefferson on the
threshold. He made no attempt to enter, nor did she invite him in.
He looked tired and careworn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you're not going to-night?&rdquo; he asked
anxiously. &ldquo;My father did not mean to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jeff,&rdquo; she said wearily; &ldquo;not to-night.
It's a little too late. I did not realize it. To-morrow morning,
early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed reassured and held out his hand:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, dearest&mdash;you're a brave girl. You made
a splendid fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It didn't do much good,&rdquo; she replied in a
disheartened, listless way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it set him thinking,&rdquo; rejoined Jefferson.
&ldquo;No one ever spoke to my father like that before. It did
<a class="pagebreak" name="page377" id="page377" title="377"></a>
him good. He's still marching up and down the library, chewing the
cud&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Noticing Shirley's tired face and her eyes, with great black
circles underneath, he stopped short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don't do any more packing to-night,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Go to bed and in the morning I'll come up and help you.
Good night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, Jeff,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>

<p>He went downstairs, and after doing some more packing she went
to bed. But it was hours before she got to sleep, and then she
dreamed that she was in the Senate Chamber and that she saw Ryder
suddenly rise and denounce himself before the astonished senators
as a perjurer and traitor to his country, while she returned to
Massapequa with the glad news that her father was acquitted.</p>

<p>Meantime, a solitary figure remained in the library, pacing to
and fro like a lost soul in Purgatory. Mrs. Ryder had returned
from the play and gone to bed, serenely oblivious of the drama in
real life that had been enacted at home, the servants locked the
house up for the night and still John Burkett Ryder walked the
floor of his sanctum, and late into the small hours of the morning
the watchman going his lonely rounds, saw a light in the library
and the restless figure of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page378" id="page378" title="378"></a>
his employer sharply silhouetted against the white blinds.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life John Ryder realized that there
was something in the world beyond Self. He had seen with his own
eyes the sacrifice a daughter will make for the father she loves,
and he asked himself what manner of a man that father could be to
inspire such devotion in his child. He probed into his own heart
and conscience and reviewed his past career. He had been
phenomenally successful, but he had not been happy. He had more
money than he knew what to do with, but the pleasures of the
domestic circle, which he saw other men enjoy, had been denied to
him. Was he himself to blame? Had his insensate craving for gold
and power led him to neglect those other things in life which
contribute more truly to man's happiness? In other words, was his
life a mistake? Yes, it was true what this girl charged, he had
been merciless and unscrupulous in his dealings with his fellow
man. It was true that hardly a dollar of his vast fortune had been
honestly earned. It was true that it had been wrung from the
people by fraud and trickery. He had craved for power, yet now he
had tasted it, what a hollow joy it was, after all! The public
hated and despised him; even his so-called friends and business
associates toadied to
<a class="pagebreak" name="page379" id="page379" title="379"></a>
him merely because they feared him. And this judge&mdash;this
father he had persecuted and ruined, what a better man and citizen
he was, how much more worthy of a child's love and of the esteem
of the world! What had Judge Rossmore done, after all, to deserve
the frightful punishment the amalgamated interests had caused him
to suffer? If he had blocked their game, he had done only what his
oath, his duty commanded him to do. Such a girl as Shirley
Rossmore could not have had any other kind of a father. Ah, if he
had had such a daughter he might have been a better man, if only
to win his child's respect and affection. John Ryder pondered
long and deeply and the more he ruminated the stronger the
conviction grew upon him that the girl was right and he was wrong.
Suddenly, he looked at his watch. It was one o'clock. Roberts had
told him that it would be an all night session and that a vote
would probably not be taken until very late. He unhooked the
telephone and calling &ldquo;central&rdquo; asked for &ldquo;long
distance&rdquo; and connection with Washington.</p>

<br />

<p>It was seven o'clock when the maid entered Shirley's room with
her breakfast and she found its occupant up and dressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you haven't been to bed, Miss!&rdquo; exclaimed
<a class="pagebreak" name="page380" id="page380" title="380"></a>
the girl, looking at the bed in the inner room which seemed
scarcely disturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Theresa I&mdash;I couldn't sleep.&rdquo; Hastily
pouring out a cup of tea she added. &ldquo;I must catch that nine
o'clock train to Washington. I didn't finish packing until nearly
three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I do anything for you, Miss?&rdquo; inquired the
maid. Shirley was as popular with the servants as with the rest of
the household.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Shirley, &ldquo;there are only a few
things to go in my suit case. Will you please have a cab here in
half an hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maid was about to go when she suddenly thought of something
she had forgotten. She held out an envelope which she had left
lying on the tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss, Mr. Jorkins said to give you this and master
wanted to see you as soon as you had finished your
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley tore open the envelope and took out the contents. It
was a cheque, payable to her order for $5,000 and signed
&ldquo;John Burkett Ryder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A deep flush covered the girl's face as she saw the
money&mdash;a flush of annoyance rather than of pleasure. This
man who had insulted her, who had wronged her father, who had
driven her from his home, thought he could throw his gold at her
and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page381" id="page381" title="381"></a>
insolently send her her pay as one settles haughtily with a
servant discharged for impertinence. She would have none of his
money&mdash;the work she had done she would make him a present of.
She replaced the cheque in the envelope and passed it back to
Theresa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give this to Mr. Ryder and tell him I cannot see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Ryder said&mdash;&rdquo; insisted the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please deliver my message as I give it,&rdquo; commanded
Shirley with authority. &ldquo;I cannot see Mr. Ryder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maid withdrew, but she had barely closed the door when it
was opened again and Mrs. Ryder rushed in, without knocking. She
was all flustered with excitement and in such a hurry that she had
not even stopped to arrange her toilet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Green,&rdquo; she gasped; &ldquo;what's
this I hear&mdash;going away suddenly without giving me
warning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn't engaged by the month,&rdquo; replied Shirley
drily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, dear, I know. I was thinking of myself. I've
grown so used to you&mdash;how shall I get on without you&mdash;no
one understands me the way you do. Dear me! The whole house is
upset. Mr. Ryder never went to bed at all last night. Jefferson is
going away,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page382" id="page382" title="382"></a>
too&mdash;forever, he threatens. If he hadn't come and woke me up
to say good-bye, I should never have known you intended to leave
us. My boy's going&mdash;you're going&mdash;everyone's deserting
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryder was not accustomed to such prolonged flights of
oratory and she sank exhausted on a chair, her eyes filling with
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they tell you who I am&mdash;the daughter of Judge
Rossmore?&rdquo; demanded Shirley.</p>

<p>It had been a shock to Mrs. Ryder that morning when Jefferson
burst into his mother's room before she was up and acquainted her
with the events of the previous evening. The news that the Miss
Green whom she had grown to love, was really the Miss Rossmore of
whose relations with Jefferson her husband stood in such dread,
was far from affecting the financier's wife as it had Ryder
himself. To the mother's simple and ingenuous mind, free from
prejudice and ulterior motive, the girl's character was more
important than her name, and certainly she could not blame her son
for loving such a woman as Shirley. Of course, it was unfortunate
for Jefferson that his father felt this bitterness towards Judge
Rossmore, for she herself could hardly have wished for a more
sympathetic daughter-in-law. She had not seen her husband since
the previous evening at dinner so was
<a class="pagebreak" name="page383" id="page383" title="383"></a>
in complete ignorance as to what he thought of this new
development, but the mother sighed as she thought how happy it
would make her to see Jefferson happily married to the girl of his
own choice, and in her heart she still entertained the hope that
her husband would see it that way and thus prevent their son from
leaving them as he threatened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's not your fault, my dear,&rdquo; she replied
answering Shirley's question. &ldquo;You are yourself&mdash;that's
the main thing. You mustn't mind what Mr. Ryder says? Business
and worry makes him irritable at times. If you must go, of course
you must&mdash;you are the best judge of that, but Jefferson wants
to see you before you leave.&rdquo; She kissed Shirley in motherly
fashion, and added: &ldquo;He has told me everything, dear.
Nothing would make me happier than to see you become his wife.
He's downstairs now waiting for me to tell him to come
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's better that I should not see him,&rdquo; replied
Shirley slowly and gravely. &ldquo;I can only tell him what I have
already told him. My father comes first. I have still a duty to
perform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's right, dear,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Ryder.
&ldquo;You're a good, noble girl and I admire you all the more for
it. I'll let Jefferson be his own advocate. You'll see him for my
sake!&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page384" id="page384" title="384"></a>
<p>She gave Shirley another affectionate embrace and left the room
while the girl proceeded with her final preparations for
departure. Presently there was a quick, heavy step in the corridor
outside and Jefferson appeared in the doorway. He stood there
waiting for her to invite him in. She looked up and greeted him
cordially, yet it was hardly the kind of reception he looked for
or that he considered he had a right to expect. He advanced
sulkily into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother said she had put everything right,&rdquo; he
began. &ldquo;I guess she was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="insquote5" id="insquote5"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother does not understand, neither do you,&rdquo;
she replied seriously. &ldquo;Nothing can be put right until my
father is restored to honour and position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should you punish me because my father fails to
regard the matter as we do?&rdquo; demanded Jefferson
rebelliously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I punish myself&mdash;why should we punish
those nearest and dearest?&rdquo; answered Shirley gently,
&ldquo;the victims of human injustice always suffer where their
loved ones are tortured. Why are things as they are&mdash;I don't
know. I know they are&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man strode nervously up and down the room while she
gazed listlessly out of the window, looking for the cab that was
to carry her away from
<a class="pagebreak" name="page385" id="page385" title="385"></a>
this house of disappointment. He pleaded with her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have tried honourably and failed&mdash;you have tried
honourably and failed.
<a name="insquote9" id="insquote9"></a>
Isn't the sting of impotent failure enough to meet without
striving against a hopeless love?&rdquo; He approached her and
said softly: &ldquo;I love you Shirley&mdash;don't drive me to
desperation. Must I be punished because you have failed? It's
unfair. The sins of the fathers should not be visited upon the
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are&mdash;it's the law,&rdquo; said Shirley
with resignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The law?&rdquo; he echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the law,&rdquo; insisted the girl; &ldquo;man's
law, not God's, the same unjust law that punishes my
father&mdash;man's law which is put into the hands of the powerful
of the earth to strike at the weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sank into a chair and, covering up her face, wept bitterly.
Between her sobs she cried brokenly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believed in the power of love to soften your father's
heart, I believed that with God's help I could bring him to see
the truth. I believed that Truth and Love would make him see the
light, but it hasn't. I stayed on and on, hoping against hope
until the time has gone by and it's too late to save him, too
late! What can I do now? My going to Washington is a forlorn hope,
a last, miserable, forlorn hope and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page386" id="page386" title="386"></a>
in this hour, the darkest of all, you ask me to think of
myself&mdash;my love, your love, your happiness, your future, my
future! Ah, wouldn't it be sublime selfishness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson kneeled down beside the chair and taking her hand in
his, tried to reason with her and comfort her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Shirley,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not do
something you will surely regret. You are punishing me not only
because I have failed but because you have failed too. It seems to
me that if you believed it possible to accomplish so much, if you
had so much faith&mdash;that you have lost your faith rather
quickly. I believed in nothing, I had no faith and yet I have not
lost hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head and gently withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless to insist, Jefferson&mdash;until my father
is cleared of this stain our lives&mdash;yours and mine&mdash;must
lie apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someone coughed and, startled, they both looked up. Mr. Ryder
had entered the room unobserved and stood watching them. Shirley
immediately rose to her feet indignant, resenting this intrusion
on her privacy after she had declined to receive the financier.
Yet, she reflected quickly, how could she prevent it? He was at
home, free to come and go as he pleased,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page387" id="page387" title="387"></a>
but she was not compelled to remain in the same room with him. She
picked up the few things that lay about and with a contemptuous
toss of her head, retreated into the inner apartment, leaving
father and son alone together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; grunted Ryder, Sr. &ldquo;I rather thought I
should find you here, but I didn't quite expect to find you on
your knees&mdash;dragging our pride in the mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's where our pride ought to be,&rdquo; retorted
Jefferson savagely. He felt in the humor to say anything, no
matter what the consequences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she has refused you again, eh?&rdquo; said Ryder, Sr.
with a grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined Jefferson with growing irritation,
&ldquo;she objects to my family. I don't blame her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The financier smiled grimly as he answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your family in general&mdash;me in particular, eh? I
gleaned that much when I came in.&rdquo; He looked towards the
door of the room in which Shirley had taken refuge and as if
talking to himself he added: &ldquo;A curious girl with an
inverted point of view&mdash;sees everything different to
others&mdash;I want to see her before she goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked over to the door and raised his hand as if he were
about to knock. Then he stopped as if
<a class="pagebreak" name="page388" id="page388" title="388"></a>
he had changed his mind and turning towards his son he
demanded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that she has done with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jefferson bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, finally&mdash;forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she mean it?&rdquo; asked Ryder, Sr.,
sceptically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;she will not listen to me while her father is
still in peril.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an expression of half amusement, half admiration on
the financier's face as he again turned towards the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's like her, damn it, just like her!&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>

<p>He knocked boldly at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; cried Shirley from within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I&mdash;Mr. Ryder. I wish to speak to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must beg you to excuse me,&rdquo; came the answer,
&ldquo;I cannot see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson interfered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to add to the girl's misery? Don't you
think she has suffered enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what she has done?&rdquo; said Ryder with
pretended indignation. &ldquo;She has insulted me grossly. I never
was so humiliated in my life. She has returned the cheque I sent
her last night in payment for her work on my biography. I mean to
<a class="pagebreak" name="page389" id="page389" title="389"></a>
make her take that money. It's hers, she needs it, her father's a
beggar. She must take it back. It's only flaunting her contempt
for me in my face and I won't permit it.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="photo6" id="photo6"></a>
<blockquote class="illustration"><a href="images/photo6.jpg">
<img src="images/photo6.png" width="266" height="450"
alt="[Photo, from the play,
of Mr. Ryder holding out a cheque to Shirley.]" /></a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="central">&ldquo;So I contaminate even good
money?&rdquo;&mdash;Act IV.</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think her object in refusing that money was to
flaunt contempt in your face, or in any way humiliate you,&rdquo;
answered Jefferson. &ldquo;She feels she has been sailing under
false colours and desires to make some reparation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so she sends me back my money, feeling that will
pacify me, perhaps repair the injury she has done me, perhaps buy
me into entering into her plan of helping her father, but it
won't. It only increases my determination to see her and
her&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly changing the topic he asked:
&ldquo;When do you leave us?&rdquo;</p>

<a name="movquote3" id="movquote3"></a>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;at once&mdash;that is&mdash;I&mdash;don't
know,&rdquo; answered Jefferson embarrassed. &ldquo;The fact is my
faculties are numbed&mdash;I seem to have lost my power of
thinking. Father,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you see what a wreck
you have made of our lives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don't moralize,&rdquo; replied his father testily,
&ldquo;as if your own selfishness in desiring to possess that girl
wasn't the mainspring of all your actions!&rdquo; Waving his son
out of the room he added: &ldquo;Now leave
<a class="pagebreak" name="page390" id="page390" title="390"></a>
me alone with her for a few moments. Perhaps I can make her listen
to reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson stared at his father as if he feared he were out of
his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Are you&mdash;?&rdquo; he
ejaculated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go&mdash;go leave her to me,&rdquo; commanded the
financier. &ldquo;Slam the door when you go out and she'll think
we've both gone. Then come up again presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stratagem succeeded admirably. Jefferson gave the door a
vigorous pull and John Ryder stood quiet, waiting for the girl to
emerge from sanctuary. He did not have to wait long. The door
soon opened and Shirley came out slowly. She had her hat on and
was drawing on her gloves, for through her window she had caught a
glimpse of the cab standing at the curb. She started on seeing
Ryder standing there motionless, and she would have retreated had
he not intercepted her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to speak to you Miss&mdash;Rossmore,&rdquo; he
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say,&rdquo; answered Shirley
frigidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you do this?&rdquo; he asked, holding out the
cheque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I do not want your money,&rdquo; she replied
with hauteur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was yours&mdash;you earned it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page391" id="page391" title="391"></a>
<p>&ldquo;No, I came here hoping to influence you to help my
father. The work I did was part of the plan. It happened to fall
my way. I took it as a means to get to your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is yours, please take it. It will be
useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said scornfully, &ldquo;I can't tell you
how low I should fall in my own estimation if I took your money!
Money,&rdquo; she added, with ringing contempt, &ldquo;why, that's
all there is to <i>you!</i> It's your god! Shall I make your god
my god? No, thank you, Mr. Ryder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I as bad as that?&rdquo; he asked wistfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are as bad as that!&rdquo; she answered
decisively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So bad that I contaminate even good money?&rdquo; He
spoke lightly but she noticed that he winced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money itself is nothing,&rdquo; replied the girl,
&ldquo;it's the spirit that gives it&mdash;the spirit that
receives it, the spirit that earns it, the spirit that spends it.
Money helps to create happiness. It also creates misery. It's an
engine of destruction when not properly used, it destroys
individuals as it does nations. It has destroyed you, for it has
warped your soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he laughed bitterly, &ldquo;I like to hear
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don't, Mr. Ryder, no you don't, for deep down in
your heart you know that I am speaking the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page392" id="page392" title="392"></a>
truth. Money and the power it gives you, has dried up the
well-springs of your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He affected to be highly amused at her words, but behind the
mask of callous indifference the man suffered. Her words seared
him as with a red hot iron. She went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the barbaric ages they fought for possession, but
they fought openly. The feudal barons fought for what they stole,
but it was a fair fight. They didn't strike in the dark. At least,
they gave a man a chance for his life. But when you modern barons
of industry don't like legislation you destroy it, when you don't
like your judges you remove them, when a competitor outbids you
you squeeze him out of commercial existence! You have no hearts,
you are machines, and you are cowards, for you fight
unfairly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not true, it is not true,&rdquo; he protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she insisted hotly, &ldquo;a few
hours ago in cold blood you doomed my father to what is certain
death because you decided it was a political necessity. In other
words he interfered with your personal interests&mdash;your
financial interests&mdash;you, with so many millions you can't
count them!&rdquo; Scornfully she added: &ldquo;Come out into the
light&mdash;fight in the open! At least, let him know who his
enemy is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop&mdash;stop&mdash;not another word,&rdquo; he cried
impatiently,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page393" id="page393" title="393"></a>
&ldquo;you have diagnosed the disease. What of the remedy? Are you
prepared to reconstruct human nature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Confronting each other, their eyes met and he regarded her
without resentment, almost with tenderness. He felt strangely
drawn towards this woman who had defied and accused him, and made
him see the world in a new light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't deny,&rdquo; he admitted reluctantly,
&ldquo;that things seem to be as you describe them, but it is part
of the process of evolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;it is the work of
God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is evolution!&rdquo; he insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that's it,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;you evolve
new ideas, new schemes, new tricks&mdash;you all worship different
gods&mdash;gods of your own making!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was about to reply when there was a commotion at the door
and Theresa entered, followed by a man servant to carry down the
trunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cab is downstairs, Miss,&rdquo; said the maid.</p>

<p>Ryder waved them away imperiously. He had something further to
say which he did not care for servants to hear. Theresa and the
man precipitately withdrew, not understanding, but obeying with
alacrity a master who never brooked delay in the execution
<a class="pagebreak" name="page394" id="page394" title="394"></a>
of his orders. Shirley, indignant, looked to him for an
explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't need them,&rdquo; he exclaimed with a quiet
smile in which was a shade of embarrassment. &ldquo;I&mdash;I came
here to tell you that I&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped as if unable to
find words, while Shirley gazed at him in utter astonishment.
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he went on finally, &ldquo;you have made it very
hard for me to speak.&rdquo; Again he paused and then with an
effort he said slowly: &ldquo;An hour ago I had Senator Roberts on
the long distance telephone, and I'm going to Washington. It's all
right about your father. The matter will be dropped. You've
beaten me. I acknowledge it. You're the first living soul who ever
has beaten John Burkett Ryder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley started forward with a cry of mingled joy and surprise.
Could she believe her ears? Was it possible that the dreaded
Colossus had capitulated and that she had saved her father? Had
the forces of right and justice prevailed, after all? Her face
transfigured, radiant she exclaimed breathlessly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Mr. Ryder, you mean that you are going to help my
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for his sake&mdash;for yours,&rdquo; he answered
frankly.</p>

<p>Shirley hung her head. In her moment of triumph,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page395" id="page395" title="395"></a>
she was sorry for all the hard things she had said to this man.
She held out her hand to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;it was for my
father. I had no faith. I thought your heart was of
stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Impulsively Ryder drew her to him, he clasped her two hands in
his and looking down at her kindly he said, awkwardly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it was&mdash;so it was! You accomplished the miracle.
It's the first time I've acted on pure sentiment. Let me tell you
something. Good sentiment is bad business and good business is bad
sentiment&mdash;that's why a rich man is generally supposed to
have such a hard time getting into the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;
He laughed and went on, &ldquo;I've given ten millions apiece to
three universities. Do you think I'm fool enough to suppose I can
buy my way? But that's another matter. I'm going to Washington on
behalf of your father because I&mdash;want you to marry my son.
Yes, I want you in the family, close to us. I want your respect,
my girl. I want your love. I want to earn it. I know I can't buy
it. There's a weak spot in every man's armour and this is
mine&mdash;I always want what I can't get and I can't get your
love unless I earn it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley remained pensive. Her thoughts were out
<a class="pagebreak" name="page396" id="page396" title="396"></a>
on Long Island, at Massapequa. She was thinking of their joy when
they heard the news&mdash;her father, her mother and Stott. She
was thinking of the future, bright and glorious with promise
again, now that the dark clouds were passing away. She thought of
Jefferson and a soft light came into her eyes as she foresaw a
happy wifehood shared with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so sober,&rdquo; demanded Ryder, &ldquo;you've
gained your point, your father is to be restored to you, you'll
marry the man you love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm so happy!&rdquo; murmured Shirley. &ldquo;I don't
deserve it. I had no faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder released her and took out his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I leave in fifteen minutes for Washington,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Will you trust me to go alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust you gladly,&rdquo; she answered smiling at him.
&ldquo;I shall always be grateful to you for letting me convert
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won me over last night,&rdquo; he rejoined,
&ldquo;when you put up that fight for your father. I made up my
mind that a girl so loyal to her father would be loyal to her
husband. You think,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that I do not love
my son&mdash;you are mistaken. I do love him and I want him to be
happy. I am capable of more affection than people think. It is
Wall Street,&rdquo; he
<a class="pagebreak" name="page397" id="page397" title="397"></a>
added bitterly, &ldquo;that has crushed all sentiment out of
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley laughed nervously, almost hysterically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to laugh and I feel like crying,&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;What will Jefferson say&mdash;how happy he will
be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you going to tell him?&rdquo; inquired Ryder
uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall tell him that his dear, good father has relented
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;you will say
nothing of the sort. I draw the line at the dear, good father act.
I don't want him to think that it comes from me at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Shirley puzzled, &ldquo;I shall have to
tell him that you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Ryder, &ldquo;acknowledge to my
son that I was in the wrong, that I've seen the error of my ways
and wish to repent? Excuse me,&rdquo; he added grimly, &ldquo;it's
got to come from him. He must see the error of <i>his</i>
ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the error of his way,&rdquo; laughed the girl,
&ldquo;was falling in love with me. I can never prove to him that
that was wrong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The financier refused to be convinced. He shook his head and
said stubbornly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he must be put in the wrong somehow or
<a class="pagebreak" name="page398" id="page398" title="398"></a>
other! Why, my dear child,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that boy has
been waiting all his life for an opportunity to say to me:
&lsquo;Father, I knew I was in the right, and I knew you were
wrong,&rsquo; Can't you see,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what a false
position it places me in? Just picture his triumph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll be too happy to triumph,&rdquo; objected
Shirley.</p>

<p>Feeling a little ashamed of his attitude, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think I'm very obstinate.&rdquo; Then, as
she made no reply, he added: &ldquo;I wish I didn't care what you
thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shirley looked at him gravely for a moment and then she replied
seriously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ryder, you're a great man&mdash;you're a
genius&mdash;your life is full of action, energy, achievement. But
it appears to be only the good, the noble and the true that you
are ashamed of. When your money triumphs over principle, when your
political power defeats the ends of justice, you glory in your
victory. But when you do a kindly, generous, fatherly act, when
you win a grand and noble victory over yourself, you are ashamed
of it. It was a kind, generous impulse that has prompted you to
save my father and take your son and myself to your heart. Why
are you ashamed to let him see it? Are you afraid he will love
you? Are you afraid I shall
<a class="pagebreak" name="page399" id="page399" title="399"></a>
love you? Open your heart wide to us&mdash;let us love
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryder, completely vanquished, opened his arms and Shirley
sprang forward and embraced him as she would have embraced her own
father. A solitary tear coursed down the financier's cheek. In
thirty years he had not felt, or been touched by, the emotion of
human affection.</p>

<p>The door suddenly opened and Jefferson entered. He started on
seeing Shirley in his father's arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeff, my boy,&rdquo; said the financier, releasing
Shirley and putting her hand in his son's, &ldquo;I've done
something you couldn't do&mdash;I've convinced Miss Green&mdash;I
mean Miss Rossmore&mdash;that we are not so bad after
all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson, beaming, grasped his father's hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's what I say&mdash;father!&rdquo; echoed
Shirley.</p>

<p>They both embraced the financier until, overcome with emotion,
Ryder, Sr., struggled to free himself and made his escape from the
room crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, children&mdash;I'm off for
Washington!&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
